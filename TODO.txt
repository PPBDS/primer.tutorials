# Planning for Tutorials

When should we do which tutorials? Ideally, we do RStudio in week 1, Terminal in week 2 and distill in week 3. But then we need (?) to not use terminal trickery on Git tutorial. Maybe that is an easy fix.

### Priorities

#### Nuo Wen Lei

Create an instructions.html file from instructions.Rmd and make sure that it is publicly available. Do this by making it an "article"" which then magically appears at https://ppbds.github.io/primer.tutorials/. Check pkgdown documentation.

Create an Add In which, for the current Rmd, changes all the code chunk names, to be what they ought to be. Tricky part: Sections titled Submission and Information should be ignored. (Or maybe it doesn't matter if they are?) Maybe the Add In also checks for those sections and adds them if needed?

Create a tutorial template for creating tutorials using Add Ins.

Mystery of permanent objects.

More functionality for downloading answers. Give students a choice: download either rds for pdf.

Take a look at R constant issue in instructions.Rmd.

Is there a way to not have to add that hackery to every tutorial.Rmd? Equivalent to #include in C. Good question for R Studio Community.

#### Nosa

* Ask RStudio Community question about next CRAN release of learnr.

* Discuss new idea for testing.

* Maybe we use available_tutorials() to get the list of tutorials but then use our by-hand render to confirm them.

* "Submit" section is poorly named since we don't really submit anything. Ought to be named "Download answers" or something like that. Make it easier for students to download their answers.

* Explain why we needed to add stuff back to Suggests.


### Tutorials to add

* Expand the Getting Started tutorial and make it better connected to the Primer chapter. Students read the chapter and then do the tutorial. The tutorial ought to confirm that they have done everything that the chapter told them to do. Even though it is done in class, it could be a bit longer, so 10 or 15 questions.

* Expand Git/Github tutorial. Need to teach about R Markdown and R Projects. Or maybe just links to an on-line tutorial which does that? Could students paste in screen shots as answers? How about if they did `head` on the files they make and copy/pasted the results?

* A making tables tutorial, focussing on gt.

* An Rpubs tutorial? Talk about rsconnect. Need to add rsconnect to .gitgnore. Maybe add this to Git/Github. Maybe reframe this whol tutorial as RStudio and Friends.

* A "census" tutorial which covers all the relevant material in the maps tutorial, but no mapping. Note that the new (dev) version of tidycensus makes it much easier to get millions of rows of ACS data.

* A "map" tutorial which starts by assuming the existence of the needed map data and then does the same map plots as in the appendix.

* An rtweet tutorial: https://github.com/ropensci/rtweet

* A permutation tests tutorial.


### To discuss

* Another example set: https://openintrostat.github.io/ims-tutorials/

* Is there a way to add a test which confirms that none of the code chunk names are duplicated? Is that useful/ncessary?

* Specify which versions of learnr (and other Github packages?) we want. Otherwise, you always get the head, which may not be desirable. Do we really still need to be using the development version of learnr? That makes me nervous! And why haven't they updated the version on CRAN for more than 15 months?

* Best single summary of tutorial tools/approaches: https://damien-datasci-blog.netlify.app/post/how-to-make-an-interactive-tutorial-to-teach-r-an-overview/

* Is there some way to ensure that all the answers we have for each question --- including complete answers we provide in hints --- work correctly. For example, if a input csv file becomes corrupted, how will we catch that?

* Is there a way to confirm that all the files we need --- because we file.copy() them --- actually exist? Can we change behavior of file.copy() so that it produces a warning if the file is not there.

* Should we set up our own site for maintaining binaries? https://ropensci.org/blog/2021/06/22/setup-runiverse/ How much does this help with installation issues?

* Another way to host the tutorials: https://higgi13425.github.io/medical_r/posts/2020-12-27-creating-mini-learnr-apps-and-hosting-on-a-server/

* .Rbuildignore should be cleaned up. See discussion in instructions.Rmd.




* How do we test just one tutorial.Rmd. Using "Run Document"", although it willl catch some problems, does not catch everything. Using "Check" works, but it takes forever because we have too many tutorials. There must be something we can do from the Console. But this might be tricky! Don't forget the (important?) distinction between raw .Rmd files and installed tutorials.




* Document the fact that, although we don't have "solutions"" for tutorials, we can use, for example, knitr::purl("inst/tutorials/000-getting-started/tutorial.Rmd") to make a tutorial.R file which includes all the R code used for the answers. Maybe that trick is enough, even though it is hard to use since the questions themselves are not provided? 95%+ of students won't care.

* Process all rds tutorial answer files and organize the results.

* When I have a link in a tutorial, and the student clicks on it, there seems to be no way to get back to the tutorial. There is no "Go Back" button. How can we fix this? Ask on RStudio Community.


* What is up with this note?

````
* checking dependencies in R code ... NOTE
Namespaces in Imports field not imported from:
  ‘grid’ ‘png’ ‘primer.data’ ‘readxl’ ‘rstanarm’ ‘tidyverse’
  All declared Imports should be used.
````

* Plots in visualization-D with vertical lines for 2* mad .


* What to do with PDF and tinytex? This all seemed to work very easily. Maybe just install and then issue packageVersion("tinytex")?

* mention iter = 10000

* Revisit making tables nice.


## Items to add to our testing process

* If you don't have an r at the start of the r code chunk options, the entire tutorial breaks and, at least sometimes, it breaks by creating the tutorial but with only questions and with three columns. Could we have a test that checks for this? Test that each code chunk options in a tutorial begins with r followed by a space.

* Can we use knitr::purl() to create .R files which might then become part of our testing process?

* We want the test to fail if there is a package like broom.mixed which is used in a tutorial but which is not in the DESCRIPTION file. **renv** might have a way to get a list of all the words which appear in any library() call within the package . . .

* Have our testing process check that all hints have eval = FALSE.

* Test for exercise chunks with no lines. This causes a weird error which is very hard to diagnose.

* Automate a test of the Submit button. Want to actually download the rds and check that it is "correct."

* Should we have the default download be a PDF file? Big benefit (?) is that it is easier for students to see what they have done all at once. Also easier (?) for TFs to grade quickly. But also easier to cheat? Also, harder to automate the processing of them. Best would be to add an option so that students can choose either rds or PDF.

### To explore later

* Consider this framework: https://github.com/noamross/gams-in-r-course

* Should our tutorials look more like this one?

https://minecr.shinyapps.io/dsbox-05-moneyinpolitics/

* Explore the use of setup chunks that are referenced by name, rather than requiring that the code chunk names match up. Example: exercise.setup = "setupA"

* Put the number of exercises in the group header so that students know how long? Or maybe put in in the exercise header in exercise 5, 10 and so on.

* Can we give students a search box in the tutorial so that they can find answers to questions they have already done?

* There is a lot of redundent text in tutorials: Write your name, submit, et cetera. Any way to avoid copying/pasting that each time? Maybe we need a "make tutorial" script which would take a raw tutorial and then add that material to it. Perhaps a template? But then we can't (?) go back and make a change in our other 20 tutorials. Maybe we need a script which finds the current version of these standard sections, deletes them, and then replaces them with the official version? Or maybe just using Find in Files and then global replace is enough . . .


* Interesting discussion and some plausible claims: http://laderast.github.io/2020/09/15/getting-learnr-tutorials-to-run-on-mybinder-org/. Claims that "the .Rmd file containing the tutorial should be named the same as the directory it is in." But why?

* https://github.com/karthik/holepunch is interesting. But it also hasn't been updated in more than 7 months.
