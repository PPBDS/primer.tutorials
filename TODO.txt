## To discuss

* Note this message:

N  checking package dependencies (4.7s)
   Imports includes 40 non-default packages.
   Importing from so many packages makes the package vulnerable to any of
   them becoming unavailable.  Move as many as possible to Suggests and
   use conditionally.

Could we move all the packages which are used by the tutorials (except the core stuff, including primer.data) into Suggests? Students would then only install when needed. But then would the test cases pass in Github Actions?

* Note this message:

N  checking installed package size ...
     installed size is 87.8Mb
     sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
       doc         5.0Mb
       help        2.5Mb
       tutorials  80.2Mb

Should there really be 80 megs of data in the tutorials?

### Visualization Links

These are handy links and ideas for the tutorials, mainly in week 1 and 2, which make plots. Many of the current plots are not that impressive.

Overview of the tutorial at the start. What functions are we covering? How do the sections related to each other? How many sections are there? How do they relate to each other? How does this tutorial relate to the other tutorials this week's?

Start providing the titles and subtitles in the question so that students could copy/paste them.

Put at the start and in the middle how long the tutorial is.


### Anmay

* Move over material to PPBDS/buggy_repo. Update Workflows tutorial accordingly.

* https://r-pkgs.org/ (Read about packages (chapters 1 and 2) and testing.) DONE

* Read all the current tests. Run them "by hand." (Tricky!) Clean up their documentation and code. DONE

* Create new file: test-code-chunks.R. It should use the tutorial_paths object to go through all tutorials, use parsermd to parse them and then check for various problems:

  + No duplicated code chunk names. DONE

  + Code chunks begin with r, followed by a space. (If you don't have an r at the start of the r code chunk options, the entire tutorial breaks and, at least sometimes, it breaks by creating the tutorial but with only questions and with three columns.) DONE

  + Check that all hints have eval = FALSE. (In other words, any code chunk with "hint" in the code chunk name should have eval = FALSE.) DONE

  + No code chunks with no lines. This causes a weird error which is very hard to diagnose. DONE

* (Delay for now.) Can we use knitr::purl() to create .R files which might then become part of our testing process? Perhaps to test whether the code in the hints is OK?

* Is there some way to ensure that all the answers we have for each question --- including complete answers we provide in hints --- work correctly. For example, if a input csv file becomes corrupted, how will we catch that?

* Update Technical Details document. It is filled with nonsense! DONE

### Yuhan

* Remove all junk files from Chapter 5.

* Discuss tutorial which would simulate the NCAA basketball tournment. What are the odds of a 5th seed winning the whole thing? Follow the 538 approach of just simulating the whole tournament a lot. Or maybe something similar but simpler?

* Discuss simulating craps. Win with 7 or 11. Lose with 2, 3, or 12. Then roll until you make your "point" and win or "crap out" by rolling  a 7.

* Review new notation in chapter.

* Give the formula for the coin and President and height examples. The mathematical distribution is one, by definition, with a formula.


Notes on Permutation Tests

* Use "There is only one test" as one of the knowledge drops, perhaps in multiple parts. Include the graphic and link to the original. http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2016/06/there-is-still-only-one-test.html

* Work through the entire simple example with N = 5. That makes things simple. Then, we do a second example, perhaps using something from primer.data, or from elsewhere. This is the approach we are currently following.





### Tutorials to add

Let's discuss the six broad categories of tutorials which we might add, especially to chapters 5 through 11.

First, we can just do more examples. Use different data with a different question, but all the same steps as in the chapter itself. Such examples will generally, like 082, do two analyses: one with all the data (to show the truth) and one in which representativeness fails in a way which we define, thereby showing how we can be led astray. Last step is to compare the answers from these two approaches, thus emphasizing the importance of humility.

Second, stand-alone tutorials on useful topics, like text modeling or networks or rtweet or whatever. These could go in any chapter and would not be restricted to having X number of parameters.

Third, we could cover many other model families, again perhaps not worrying too much about whether or not they have the "right" number of parameters. Simplest here would be other stan_glm families. That is, show a weird data set in which the outcome variable is something that should be fit with poisson or something, and then use family = poisson. Goal would be to emphasize that there are many possible models.

Fourth, expanding on the above, we might have some machine learning examples. After all, a machine-learning model is just a different kind of black box, not different conceptually than a linear or logistic model. We could fit a machine learning model on chapter 8 scenarios. Even though there are way more than three parameters in such models, they still can (I think!) be made to work in cases with just one input variable.

Fifth, real world data science examples which do not hide the messy complexity of the world. I guess that these would be a lot like the overview tutorials, but with 30 minutes of data cleaning first. These might also explicitly assume that you have done all the other tutorials in the chapter and that, therefore, we do not need to walk you through how to estimate a stan_glm() with five baby questions. Instead, the questions would be, not really harder, but messier.

Sixth, tutorials about interpreting parameters. We could have one of these in every chapter from 6 onward. These could be short! They would only cover parameter interpretation, perhaps only using the models which were used in the chapter.

Obviously, we could also combine these in various ways. Upon reflction, we should save the machine learning examples for later chapters in which we have several righhand side variables. Indeed, we could have three machine learning tutorials in chapter 11.

* Compare results from rstanarm model to an approach, like we learned in Chapter 5, in which we do the analysis "by hand," creating the joint distribution and then the posterior distribution. This is easiest to do for Chapter 6. Indeed, you can just take the code from Chapter 5, make it continuous by sampling lost of possible values, and then compare to rstanarm. Should work fine. More ambitiously, we could do this for Chapter 7. This requires a three dimensional joint distribution because there are two unknown parameters and then a two dimensional posterior, with one dimension for mu and one for sigma. This is cool! But perhaps over kill.

* Expand the Getting Started tutorial and make it better connected to the Primer chapter. Students read the chapter and then do the tutorial. The tutorial ought to confirm that they have done everything that the chapter told them to do. Even though it is done in class, it could be a bit longer, so 10 or 15 questions.


* A "models" which would be a full dry run of their final projects. Download some data (maybe lots of little data files) with an R script. Clean the data in other R script. Make the model (a simple two parameter model) in another R script. Then, make a distill package which uses the model to make pretty pictures which answer a couple of questions. Should show results using gtsummary to make pretty tables of model results. Might even show how stan_glm() models differ from lm() models. Or maybe run stan_glm() with option to get the lm() results. Example usage: https://ipums.github.io/pma-data-hub/posts/2021-07-01-covid-tables/

* Advanced plotting, ideally focussed on all a variety of different plotting approaches designed for modeling-type questions and answers. Maybe https://feddelegrand7.github.io/ddplot/.

* Would it be possible to have tutorials in the last few weeks which were, more or less, final project check-ins . . .

* A tutorial about working with textual data. Perhaps based on tidytext book. Also: https://datavizs21.classes.andrewheiss.com/example/13-example/


* An rtweet tutorial: https://github.com/ropensci/rtweet


### To discuss

* Another example set: https://openintrostat.github.io/ims-tutorials/

* Specify which versions of learnr (and other Github packages?) we want. Otherwise, you always get the head, which may not be desirable. Do we really still need to be using the development version of learnr? That makes me nervous! And why haven't they updated the version on CRAN for more than 15 months?

* Best single summary of tutorial tools/approaches: https://damien-datasci-blog.netlify.app/post/how-to-make-an-interactive-tutorial-to-teach-r-an-overview/


* Another way to host the tutorials: https://higgi13425.github.io/medical_r/posts/2020-12-27-creating-mini-learnr-apps-and-hosting-on-a-server/


* Plots in visualization-D with vertical lines for 2* mad .

* mention iter = 10000




### To explore later

* Powerful approach for hosting cool looking tutorials: https://github.com/ines/course-starter-r. One example of a tutorial using this approach:  https://github.com/noamross/gams-in-r-course

* Should our tutorials look more like this one? https://minecr.shinyapps.io/dsbox-05-moneyinpolitics/. I don't think so. Too many words, not enough typing.

* Explore the use of setup chunks that are referenced by name, rather than requiring that the code chunk names match up. Example: exercise.setup = "setupA"

* Put the number of exercises in the group header so that students know how long? Or maybe put in in the exercise header in exercise 5, 10 and so on.

* Can we give students a search box in the tutorial so that they can find answers to questions they have already done?


* Interesting discussion and some plausible claims: http://laderast.github.io/2020/09/15/getting-learnr-tutorials-to-run-on-mybinder-org/. Claims that "the .Rmd file containing the tutorial should be named the same as the directory it is in." But why?

* https://github.com/karthik/holepunch is interesting. But it also hasn't been updated in more than 7 months.





### Allison Horst interview

The main question was: How do we incorporate tutorial questions directly into the chapter itself? Allison is the world expert on this topic.

* She is concerned about user loads for published Shiny apps - would recommend that we use the basic or higher plan.

* She thinks using Desiree's method of embedding one exercise at a time might get unreasonable for a book of our size, but suggested that we could host 12 different ShinyApps corresponding to each chapter, and then link to each chapter in one central location. (Kind of like the combined tutorials app Evelyn created via HMDC.)

* How did you decide which exercises were going to be "tutorials" and which would be "exercises"? She wanted the exercises to be incremental, so a lot of the code was already pre-populated. The exercises that were blank built directly off of code that was already shown before, so that students could have an "easy win" by just copying the previous code and tweaking a variable name. Allison thinks that this incremental process is important for beginner R students.

* How much memory does the ShinyApp consume? Do you know of any tricks to make learnr tutorials smaller? She recommends that we contact the team at RStudio Education - this is not her area of expertise. Allison says that the RStudio Education team is super eager to hear about learnr use cases, would be happy to talk to us, and would even ask us to write a blog post. She also mentioned that the team would know the most about cutting-edge learnr stuff, including things like a "completion rate" bar that shows students how far they are through a tutorial.

* Any tips for remote teaching or learning? Using learnr at all is a big step. Allison also pre-records short versions of her lectures for her students to stream at a later time,  and holds smaller discussion sections in class where they do activities.

* Allison's #1 Recommendation to remote teachers of R: Having students start out with RStudio Cloud and then transitioning to Desktop. You can set up workspaces so the necessary packages are already loaded and installed, any script is already pre-loaded, and all students need to do is log in. It looks exactly the same as RStudio Desktop except folks don't have to worry about installing R or RStudio. You can push/pull from git in RStudio Cloud as well (link to a Rstudio cloud tutorial/article: https://rstudio.com/resources/webinars/teaching-r-online-with-rstudio-cloud/)

Interesting discussion of using art to bring students into data science.

Consider the use of ggirl package for encouraging students to send someone an actual postcard.
