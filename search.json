First, relationship among variables demonstrate stability, meaning model stable across different time periods? Second, rows associated data , separately, rows associated Preceptor Table, representative units population? Third, causal models , consider unconfoundedness. ### Validity Validity consistency, lack thereof, columns data set corresponding columns Preceptor Table. order consider two data sets drawn population, columns one must valid correspondence columns . Validity, true (least reasonable), allows us construct Population Table, first step Justice. Validity discussions always one (short) paragraph relevant variable (outcome relevant covariates), examples validity might hold. Validity discussion finishes brief discussion along lines : “Despite concerns, assume validity hold.” section can longer course, depending many details discussed EDA. central point two (potentially!) completely different things: Preceptor Table data.

Courage third Cardinal Virtue data science. Justice gives us Population Table. Courage creates data generating mechanism. first specify mathematical formula connects outcome variable interested data . explore different models. need decide variables include estimate values unknown parameters. check models consistency data . avoid hypothesis tests. select one model, data generating mechanism. Courage begins discussion functional form using. usually straight-forward follows directly type outcome variable: continuous means linear model, two categories (binary) implies logistic, --two categories suggests multinomial logistic. provide mathematical formula model, using y x variables. don’t yet know number right-hand side variables include, much less ones. , formula generic. rest discussion broken three sections: “Models,” “Tests,” “Data Generating Mechanism.” exploring different models, need decide variables include estimate values unknown parameters. estimate models print model results. give another version math, use tbl_regression() yet. goal explore interpret different models. parameter’s estimated value 2 3 standard errors away zero, generally keep parameter (associated variable) model. , probably, variable “matters.” main exception rule parameter whose value close zero changes associated variable, within general range variable, can’t change value outcome much. Depending chapter, use different tools choose among different possible models. Interpreting meaning parameter estimates takes practice. Consider simple linear model. Let’s go example Q&, followed commentary: Q: Write sentence interpreting -0.83 estimate sexMale. : comparing men women, men 0.83 lower value att_end, meaning liberal immigration, relative women, conditional variables model. Whenever consider non-treatment variables, must never use terms like “cause,” “impact” . can’t make statement implies existence one potential outcome based changes non-treatment variables. can’t make claims within row effects. Instead, can compare across rows. Always use phrase “comparing X Y” something similar. phrase “conditional variables model” important. shortened “conditional model.” phrase acknowledges many, many possible models, just considering different combinations independent variables might include. one produce different coefficient sexmale. None true coefficient. claim make -0.83, specific number, always conditional fact assume model true, covariates, others, belong regression. mean always use phrase? . leave time. always understood knowledgeable readers. Q: Write sentence interpreting confidence interval sexMale. : know true value coefficient sexMale, can 95% confident lies somewhere -1.86 0.21. Bayesians, believe true value confidence credible uncertainty interval includes stated level. time parameters model direct relationship population parameter might interested. especially true complex /non-linear models. , cases, coefficient like β1\\beta_1 “mean” anything. , simple, small, linear models, sometimes happens parameter correspond something real. case, coefficient sexmale difference population average att_end men women, adjusting variables model. Q: Interpret 1.41 estimate treatmentTreated. : causal model, average causal effect receiving treatment hearing Spanish-speakers train platform, relative control, 1.41 higher value att_end, meaning treatment, relative control, makes one conservative immigration. : predictive model, , compare people receive treatment people receive control, treated people , average, 1.41 conservative attitude toward immigration, adjusting individual characteristics. interpretation treatment variable different interpretation standard covariate. key point thing causal (versus preditive) data set causal (versus predictive) R code formula. can use data set (R code!) causal predictive models. difference lies assumptions make.

Q: Interpret -0.01 estimate age. : compare one group people ten years older another, older group , average, attitude toward immigration 0.1 unit lower, .e., less conservative. Numeric variables harder binary variables longer just two well-defined groups compare . must create two groups . Fortunately, long interaction terms, can just pick two groups values variable. common two groups differ one unit variable. quite common use groups differ /less seems sensible /makes math easier. case, two groups differ 10 years makes sense reasons. non-linear models, linear models lots interaction terms? linear model, interpretations fairly straightforward. type model, math difficult head. can’t just look coefficient 5 know means magnitude. can tell direction, positive 5 means higher values covariate associated higher values outcome variable. , anything linear models, restrict direction significance interpretations. Q: Write sentence interpreting 0.37 estimate sexmale. : comparison women, men likely arrested. Categorical variables (NN categories), like sex (two values), always replaced (N−1N-1) 0/1 dummy variables like sexMale. can’t (easily) know big 0.37 . model non-linear, can’t (easily) determine whether men 1% 50% likely arrested. Q: Write sentence interpreting 1.07 1.31 confidence interval raceblack. : comparison Asian/Pacific Islanders, Blacks likely arrested. fact, likely arrested racial group. Dummy variables must always interpreted context base value variable, generally included intercept. example, base value “asian/pacific islander.” (base value first alphabetically default character variables. However, factor variable, can change setting order levels hand.) look two things confidence interval. First, exclude zero? , can’t sure relationship positive negative. Second, overlap confidence intervals dummy columns derived variable? , can sure ordering comparisons bigger. overlap, example raceother raceunknown, can’t sure average comparison go. estimate raceother larger estimate raceunknown, best guess members former group likely arrested. , confidence intervals overlap, good chance (5% certainly) ordering opposite. recommend verb “adjust” place “control” discussing effect including variables model. Example: “causal effect exposure Spanish-speakers 1.5, adjusting variables like age party.” word “adjusting” better word “controlling” demonstrates humility. advanced models, less relevant sorts interpretations. , don’t really care parameters, much less interpret .

Review three levels “truth”: Knowing entries Preceptor Table, knowing true DGM, using estimated DGM.

Sadly, case toy examples involving things like coins dice. hope DGM close true DGM , since assumption never perfectly correct, DGM always different. estimated magnitude importance difference matter judgment. problem concluding paragraph implies DGM truth, rather just imperfect approximation true DGM. two main ways DGM might wrong.
