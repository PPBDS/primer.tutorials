#' Tutorial Written Exercise (With Answer)
#'
#' @description
#'
#' An add-in for writing primer.tutorials.
#'
#' It reads the latest exercise and section name
#' and then adds a question skeleton (with answers and no retries).
#'
#' This should make things easier for tutorial-writers
#' because now a fast click can create most of the exercise for you.
#'
#' There is also no need to keep track of the exercise numbers
#' because it is done for you in the add-in.
#'
#' Keyboard shortcut should be Cmd + SHIFT + E (MAC)
#'
#' @return question skeleton with appropriate labels and numbers

  # Steps:
  # 1. get destination of add-in
  # 2. find the correct label and exercise number

  # and find the latest exercise as well as section.

  # If a section is found first, the loop is stopped immediately
  # because that means the exercise to be inserted is exercise 1.

  # If an exercise is found first, continue the loop until finding a section,
  # so we can get both the section label and the latest exercise number.
