#' Format Tutorial
#'
#' @description
#'
#' An add-in for formatting primer.tutorials.
#'
#' It adjusts the code and hint chunk labels correctly.
#'
#' This should make things easier for tutorial-writers
#' because it will allow fast chunk label updating and quick formatting
#' and checking
#'
#' There is also no need to keep track of the exercise numbers
#' because it is done for you in the add-in.
#'
#'
#' @return formatted document with correct code and hint chunk labels

  # This is quite interesting.
  #
  # The parsermd already has a as_document function
  # that should've taken care of turning the changed Rmd structure
  # into raw text.
  #
  # However, there was a thing with Rmarkdown sections in the structure
  # where each time it is updated, it adds a newline to the section because
  # while parsing, newlines counted as part of the Rmarkdown section.
  #
  # This created a cycle where each time an Rmd is checked, it would be
  # padded with as many newlines as there are Rmarkdown sections.
  #
  # Therefore, I had to make my own way of transforming the Rmd back
  # to plain text

  # The only unique thing this part does is that it removes
  # the last character of every Rmarkdown section, which is always
  # a newline before adding it to the full document.
