#' Get Submissions from a learnr Session

get_submissions_from_learnr_session <- function(sess){

  # This is an annoying link of the entire chain of building the submission
  # report because it has to communicate with the learnr session ENVIRONMENT,
  # not just the object.

  # Since we are using the session environment, we currently don't have a way to
  # save the environment and hence can't test this function.

  # So learnr:::get_all_state_objects() finds and returns ALL state objects
  # relating to the session environment and tutorial. This includes the tutorial
  # id, version, submissions, everything that defines the current "state".

  # learnr:::submissions_from_state_objects() then filters the results to only
  # submission-related state objects, which are the student answers.

  # objs <- learnr:::get_all_state_objects(sess)
  # learnr:::submissions_from_state_objects(objs)

  # In the commits on August 12th and 14th, the need to use any ::: have been
  # eliminated as we can read all the tutorial info and state from newly
  # provided functions:
  # learnr::get_tutorial_state()
  # learnr::get_tutorial_info()

  # Unfortunately, the answers in learnr::get_tutorial_state() are not provided
  # in order of appearance, so we still need get_label_list() to get the label
  # order
