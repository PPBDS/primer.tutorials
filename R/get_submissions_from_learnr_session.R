  # This is an annoying link of the entire chain of building the submission
  # report because it has to communicate with the learnr session ENVIRONMENT,
  # not just the object.

  # Since we are using the session environment, we currently don't have a way to
  # save the environment and hence can't test this function.

  # So learnr:::get_all_state_objects() finds and returns ALL state objects
  # relating to the session environment and tutorial. This includes the tutorial
  # id, version, submissions, everything that defines the current "state".

  # learnr:::submissions_from_state_objects() then filters the results to only
  # submission-related state objects, which are the student answers.

  objs <- learnr:::get_all_state_objects(sess)
  learnr:::submissions_from_state_objects(objs)
}
