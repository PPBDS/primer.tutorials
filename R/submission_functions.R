# Next time we revisit this, consider some changes. First, split this file into
# two. One part has the two functions we use: submission_server() and
# submission_ui. The second part has all the helper functions.

# Second, bringing in the learnr functions somehow. I hate being dependent on
# learnr given how unresponsive they are. We could just make copies of the
# functions we use. Or we could just incorporate the key code from those
# functions where we need them.

# What we really want is a single function which, when called from the tutorial,
# does all the stuff we need. But, presumably, that is impossible. We need (?) a
# Shiny server and Shiny ui. This is not (?) any other way to produce this
# effect.

# Want to change the color to the OK box so that it is green when students enter
# their email or other text. This seem relevant:

# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33620133/change-the-color-of-action-button-in-shiny/35871042

# But where, exactly, do we add this code given that we don't control the Shiny
# sessions which learnr itself starts and stops?

# Ought to understand and explain exactly what shiny::div() does.
# NL: Creates an html <div></div> element.

#' The following function was modified from Colin Rundel's learnrhash package,

#' This note is also modified from Professor Rundel's description: Note that
#' when including these functions in a learnr Rmd document it is necessary that
#' the server function, `submission_server()`, be included in an R chunk where
#' `context="server"`. Conversely, any of the ui functions, `*_ui()`, must *not*
#' be included in an R chunk with a `context`.

  # We need information from the parent frame --- from the learnr code which is
  # running this tutorial. This is the environment which is calling this
  # function, submission_server. Only this parent environment has access to
  # objects (like input, output, and session) which we need to access. So,
  # local() makes everything below evaluated in the parent frame.

      # different for each tutorial. But how do we know the name of the tutorial
      # in the middle of the session? It is easy to access some information from
      # the session object if we know the correct learnr function. (Note that
      # the call to session only seems to work within a reactive function like

        # users to generate the hash by pressing a button. But this is hardly
        # necessary. We can just do it here, whenever users press the download
        # button. Would be nice to get the learnr people to export these
        # functions so that the ::: hack is not necessary. I have submitted a
        # request: https://github.com/rstudio/learnr/issues/454. The functions
        # are small, so we might just copy them over. But given that we need
