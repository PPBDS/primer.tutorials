#' Make New Exercise
#'
#' @description
#'
#' An add-in for writing primer.tutorials.
#'
#' It reads the latest exercise and section name
#' and then adds an exercise skeleton.
#'
#' This should make things easier for tutorial-writers
#' because now a fast click can create most of the exercise for you.
#'
#' There is also no need to keep track of the exercise numbers
#' because it is done for you in the add-in.
#'
#' Keyboard shortcut should be Cmd + SHIFT + E (MAC)
#'
#' @return exercise skeleton with appropriate labels and numbers

  # 1. get destination of add-in
