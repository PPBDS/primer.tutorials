\title{Write a tribble template with placeholders for a character vector of column names}
\usage{
write_input_tribble(names)
}
\arguments{
\item{names}{Character vector of column names.}
}
\value{
Character string containing the R code for an input tribble with placeholders \code{"..."},
formatted for manual editing with aligned columns.
}
\description{
Generates a character string representing R code for a \code{tibble::tribble()}
with the specified column names and 3 rows filled with placeholder
text \code{"..."}. Column values are aligned under their headers for easy editing.
}
\details{
This function is primarily used internally by \code{make_p_tables()} to generate
properly formatted tribble code that gets inserted into Quarto documents.
The alignment ensures that when users edit the placeholders, they can easily
see which column they're working in.

\examples{
# Generate tribble code for a simple table
cat(write_input_tribble(c("Student", "Year", "Grade")))

# Generate tribble code for a causal inference table
causal_cols <- c("Senator", "Session Year", "Vote if Contact", "Vote if No Contact", 
                 "Lobbying Contact", "Senator Age")
cat(write_input_tribble(causal_cols))
