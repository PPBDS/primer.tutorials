<!-- Material for Finals Project -->

<!-- Teach about how to make math text for the models page. -->

<!-- Teach how to make a table with fitted model statistics. -->

<!-- * There is a Models page, created from `models.qmd`, which provides details about the model which you used. This does not show any code. Indeed, nowhere does the project show code. If someone wants to look at your code, they can go to your Github repo. First, this page will include the mathematical formula of your final model. (See examples in the Primer.) Second, this page will include information about the model's parameters, generated from the fitted model. This can take the form of a table --- see the **gtsummary** package for a useful approach: https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/. Or you can just print out the fitted model. Third, explain what the parameters of the model mean. Again, the Primer has many useful examples. -->

<!-- * Do not mention the Cardinal Virtues. No one else uses those as we do, as a map for tackling a data science project. Feel free to discuss topics like validity, stability and representativeness. Those concepts are used by everyone. But you don't have to discuss them. -->

<!-- * Optionally, you might have other pages, named however you like, that answer other questions and/or try other models. How would you answer change if you used a different model from the one you eventually settled on? Think of these as "stories" which you might tell someone interested in your topic, each page a separate "exhibit" which tells the reader something interesting about the data or the model or the answer. -->

<!-- ### Exercise 4 -->

<!-- Projects with a statistical model should devote the 4th sentence to describing the model. (Projects without a statistical model will generally not have a fourth sentence.) -->

<!-- Enter your fourth sentences into the box below, if you have one. For example, "I estimated a Bayesian regression model with song positivity as the dependent variable and year as an independent variable." "I created a Bayesian linear model with state Covid mortality rate as the dependent variable and state population total as the independent variable." -->

<!-- Obviously, if you model is more complex --- if, for example, it includes several right-hand side variables --- your sentence should be longer, within reason. -->

<!-- With a statistical model, we would have: -->

<!-- The prevalent emotions in mainstream music have been changing every decade. The following data was pulled from the spotifyr and billboard packages. Then, the relevant data frames were joined to analyze the relationship between the intensity and positivity of tracks from the 1960s to the 2010s. I estimated a Bayesian regression model with song positivity as the dependent variable and year as an independent variable. Each decade since the 1960s has been associated with a 5% increase in anger, plus or minus 1%. -->

<!-- Covid-19 deaths vary tremendously by state. This was sourced from a data set which used data originally from the CDC. Mapping data was then used to visualize the Covid-19 deaths by state in an intuitive format. An extra million people in a state's population is associated with a 2% to 8% increase in Covid deaths. -->

<!-- Stuff for this tutorial -->



<!-- We ought to change this tutorial so that the questions confirm that the student has done all of the detailed advice we put in the opening section. -->


<!-- Make sure that the index.qmd page is cool, grabs the readers attention. Must show nice plot at top. -->

<!-- Instruct how to make the plot labs() bigger, which is needed for nice viewing on the web. -->

<!-- Check for default garbage. It should all be gone! Like, from index.qmd, "Learn more about creating websites" We check that they did this by grepping for "Learn more" and expecting it to return nothing.  -->

<!-- Check out the Github repo for their project. Github repo should not be `final-project`. Must be descriptive! Good occasion to teach them how to change the name of a Github repo. Show them how to do it. First, pull/push everything so that it is all on Github. Then delete the R project folder. Then change name of repo. Then re-clone it using the new url.   Perhaps they don't have to do this, if they have a reasonable name. But we show them how! Then demand that they do it on their own. Confirm that this works. -->

<!-- Explain about changing the slug! -->

<!-- Discuss _publish.yml.  -->


<!-- Tell them you should have as many lines of comments as you have lines of code. Something which shows you added some code comments. Something like grep "#" index.qmd -->

<!-- Tell them to finish a draft of their projects before doing this tutorial in a halfway fashion. -->



## Introduction
### 

In my teaching, students complete two main projects. The first one, after 4 weeks of work, is a "data" project. The second one, after 8 weeks of work, is a "model" project. In an 8 week course, this second project is often referred to as the "final" project.

This tutorial is for the data project.

Your projects are the first entries in your professional portfolio. Few employers will ever ask to see your high school or college transcripts. They will want to see what you can **do**, what you can **make** with your own two hands. 

### 

Here is a long list of key elements for every project. Read through this list and then create a rough draft of your project. Only continue this tutorial *after* you have completed a rough draft.

* The project is stored in a public repo under your Github account with a sensible name like `baseball-pitching` not a stupid name like `my-data-final`. This repo is clean and well-organized. It has a simple README which describes the project and, at the top, provides a link to your Quarto website. All junk files have been deleted. If there are a lot of individual files --- like a dozen csv files for the raw data --- then you should organize them sensibly, for example by storing them all in a `data/` directory.

* There is a Quarto website. The home page, which is created from `index.qmd`, should grab the readers attention. It includes one plot, the most interesting/important plot which you have. It also includes your paragraph summary of the project. It is clean and professional looking. It does not show code or stupid messages.

* There is an About page, created from `about.qmd`. It includes at least three sentences, each separated by a blank line. This first sentence is about who you are, including a link to your Github account and an email address which people can use to contact you. (This can be more than one sentence, if you like.) The second sentence is about your project and includes a link to the Github repo for this project. The third sentence is "This project was created as a part of Kane's Data Science Bootcamp." linking the name of the course to the webpage: https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/. Feel free to word this sentence however you like.

* There is a Sources page, created from `sources.qmd`, which provides a paragraph or two of prose about the data sources for your project. Where did you get the data from? What did you do to clean the data? Which observations, if any, did you remove? 

* Optionally, you might have other pages, named however you like, that explore other aspects of the data. Think of these as "stories" which you might tell someone interested in your topic, each page a separate "exhibit" which tells the reader something interesting about the data.

### 

**Finish at least a rough draft of your project before starting this tutorial.** This tutorial does not show you how to make a good project. Instead, it just allows us to confirm that you have done so.


## Pimp Your GitHub Account
### 

Your GitHub account should look professional. This section will guide you. Read [this essay](https://davidkane.info/writings/pimp-my-github.html) for details about what that means.

### Exercise 1

Write a bio for your GitHub account. Once you have added it to your account, copy and paste the bio below.

### 

```{r pimp-your-github-account-1}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 6)
```

### Exercise 2

Add a photo to your GitHub account. You do not have to use a photo of yourself — some people are shy — but you should use something other than the GitHub default.


### 

Once the photo is uploaded, find it go to your profile page (`github.com/your-username`). Right click your updated profile picture and press "Open image in new tab".

```{r out.width = "700px"}
include_graphics("images/open_profile.png")
```

Depending on your browser, "Copy Image Address" might also work.

Either way, copy/paste the url of the page containing your photo here:

```{r pimp-your-github-account-2}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 1)
```

### 

Your answer should look something like:

````
https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4552851?v=4
````

### Exercise 3

Pin your final project repo to your profile page following the instructions listed [here](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/pinning-items-to-your-profile).

### 

Paste the URL of your pimped GitHub account below. It should looks like `github.com/your-username`.

```{r pimp-your-github-account-3}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 1)
```

## Create Your Project Summary
### 

Every project needs an four sentence summary. This will be used in two places. First, it will go on your `index.qmd` page. Second, you will speak it at the beginning of your Demo Day presentation.

### Exercise 1

The first sentence includes the key nouns used in the title of your project and/or the title of your key graphic, either as a simple statement or a rhetorical question.

### 

Enter your first sentence in the box below. For example, "The prevalent emotions in mainstream music have been changing every decade." or "Covid-19 deaths vary tremendously by state."

```{r create-your-project-summary-1}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 2)
```

### 

A good first sentence will set the foundation for the rest of the introduction while keeping the listener engaged. An example of a **bad** first sentence is "I studied Covid deaths in my project".

### Exercise 2

Next we'll be making our last sentence. (Yes, we're going out of order). This should include the key takeaway from your project that you want people to remember, almost always a claim about how variable X varies with variable Y. Since you have not created a formal statistical model for this project, the statement will just be directional. 

### 

Enter your fourth sentence in the box below. For example, "Today's music is almost twice as angry as the music from the 1960's" or "The number of Covid-19 deaths in the 15 hardest hit states is greater than the rest combined". Those are good examples of statements for projects without a statistical model. 

With a statistical model, we will have specific numbers to include. Examples: "Each decade since the 1960s has been associated with a 5% increase in anger, plus or minus 1%." "In comparing two states, one with an extra million people, the larger state has a 2% to 8% increase in Covid deaths."

```{r create-your-project-summary-2}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 2)
```

### 

An example of a **bad** fourth sentence: "This study's analysis will provide answers to which factors cause more Covid-19 deaths to occur."

<!-- ### -->

<!-- Note that the sentences feature a specific number, as well as a range describing your uncertainty about that number. You need both. You do not need to use overly "statistical" language. After all, you are communicating mostly with non-statisticians. -->

### Exercise 3

The second and third sentences are all about your data. Where did you get it? How did you clean it? How are variables X and Y measured and defined? 

### 

Enter your second and third sentences into the box below. For example, "The following data was pulled from the spotifyr and billboard packages. Then, the relevant data frames were joined to analyze the relationship between the intensity and positivity of tracks from the 1960s to the 2010s." or "This was sourced from a data set which used data originally from the CDC. Mapping data was then used to visualize the Covid-19 deaths by state in an intuitive format".

```{r create-your-project-summary-3}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

A ***bad** example of the second and third sentences is "I have used an online data set to show Covid in the country using fill. I wanted to do this in order to show the relationships in the data."


 

### Exercise 4

<!-- DK: These examples could be better. Perhaps replace them with examples from June 2023 class. -->

It's time to put all all 4 of the sentences together! Paste the compendium of your sentences from the exercises above into the answer box below. 

### 

Here are both of the example paragraphs in the case without a statistical model: 
  
The prevalent emotions in mainstream music have been changing every decade. The following data was pulled from the spotifyr and billboard packages. Then, the relevant data frames were joined to analyze the relationship between the intensity and positivity of tracks from the 1960s to the 2010s. The analysis found that today's music is almost twice as angry as the music from the 1960's.

Covid-19 deaths vary tremendously by state. This was sourced from a data set which used data originally from the CDC. Mapping data was then used to visualize the Covid-19 deaths by state in an intuitive format. The visualization exemplifies the fact that the number of Covid-19 deaths in the 15 hardest hit states is greater than the rest combined. 


```{r create-your-project-summary-4}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 5)
```

Read your paragraph aloud to make sure it sounds right and makes sense to the listener as a paragraph. If needed, add transitions between sentences and extra information.

### 

You're ready to practice presenting your project in class!

## Meet Project Requirements
### 

Now, we'll make sure that your project has everything it needs to look professional.

### Exercise 1

Make sure that this tutorial is open in the same RStudio instance as your project for the rest of this section.

### 

First, let's check whether you have the appropriate files in your project. Run `list.files()` in the Console (same instance as your project). CP/CR.

```{r meet-project-requirements-1}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 4)
```

This should return files like "index.qmd", "about.qmd", "sources.qmd", and "_quarto.yml" at the bare minimum.

### Exercise 2

We'll now examine each file, starting with `index.qmd`. 

In the Console, run:

```
tutorial.helpers::show_file("index.qmd")
```

CP/CR.


```{r meet-project-requirements-2}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 4)
```

### 

The result should include your summary paragraph and a cool looking graphic. Whether or not your graphic or your text is on top is up to you. We generally put the graphic on top.


You might have the actual **ggplot2** code which creates the image here. Or, you might have a script elsewhere which creates the image and just load it up here. Either way, the purpose of the graphic is to cause people to say, "Hmm. That is interesting. Tell me more."


### Exercise 3

Now let's check the "About" page.

You should have already delete dthe default text such as "About this site" and "Some additional details about the website".

### 

In the Console, run `show_file("index.qmd", pattern = "About this site")`. CP/CR. 

(Obviously, this command won't work unless you have loaded the **tutorial.helpers** package in the Console with `library(tutorial.helpers)`.)


```{r meet-project-requirements-3}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

This should **not** return anything if you've correctly removed the default text.

### Exercise 4

Make sure if you added the required three sentences to the About page. (You can add more, if you like.)

In the Console, run `show_file("about.qmd")`. CP/CR.

```{r meet-project-requirements-4}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### Exercise 5

Make sure that you've added your email somewhere in your About Page so that visitors have the option to contact you regarding the project. 

In the Console, run `show_file("about.qmd", pattern = '@')`. CP/CR.

```{r meet-project-requirements-5}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

This should return the line with your email. If nothing is returned, you haven't included an email address.

### Exercise 6

Make sure that you've added a link to your GitHub repo for this project as a hyperlink in your About page. 

In the Console, run `show_file("about.qmd", pattern = 'github')`. CP/CR.

```{r meet-project-requirements-6}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

This should return the line with the link to your repo.

### Exercise 7

Make sure that you've added a link to the course homepage as a hyperlink in your About page. 

In the Console, run `show_file("about.qmd", pattern = 'davidkane')`. CP/CR.

```{r meet-project-requirements-7}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 3)
```

### 

This should return the line which includes `[Kane's Free Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/)`, or something similar.

### 

Congratulations, you're project is ready for submission!

## Project Spreadsheet
### 

To "submit" your project, we'll be adding it as a row in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ed0rhPzqfeyZGWaHVHGOciMKU5373bEQqEH4ZFJcQcg/edit?usp=sharing). This section will guide you through that process. The information you enter will be used to populate our [final project website](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/projects.html).


### Exercise 1

Open the spreadsheet linked above. In the first column enter your email. This should be your personal email (not associated with your school or organization). Enter your name in column "B" as well.

Paste the email you entered in the spreadsheet below.

```{r project-spreadsheet-1}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 2)
```

### 

Keep in mind that this information will go directly into our [final project website](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/projects.html). So, for example, enter your name (i.e., David or Dave) in the spreadsheet as your want it to appear in the permanent project listing.

### Exercise 2

In column "C" you should paste the link to your Github account. This should be the same page that you personalized when you "Pimped your Github". The link should **NOT** be the URL to your project's Github page.

Paste this Github account link in the answer box below.

```{r project-spreadsheet-2}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 2)
```

### Exercise 3

Next we'll enter your project name in column "D". This should be a relatively short title which describes your project's topic in [Title case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case).

Enter your project title below.

```{r project-spreadsheet-3}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 2)
```

### Exercise 4

In column "E", you'll enter the **Quarto Pub** link to your project website. It should look like `https://your-username.quarto.pub/your-project-slug`. This should **NOT** be the URL to your project GitHub Repo.

Enter this project URL in the box below.

```{r project-spreadsheet-4}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 2)
```

### Exercise 5

In the final column, you'll enter a one sentence takeaway of your project. This can be the last sentence from the project summary you created earlier, although you might modify it since the reader would not have seen the other sentences in the paragraph. Make sure you use proper spelling and grammar conventions.

Enter your takeaway sentence below.

```{r project-spreadsheet-5}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 2)
```

Make sure you have the same information in the tutorial and on the spreadsheet. 

## Summary
### 

Your project is the first entry in your professional portfolio. As long as you follow all the instructions in this tutorial, people (including professional data scientists) will be impressed.
