## Accessing the Census API
###

In this tutorial, we will cover how to download US Census Bureau data into R and then use it to create graphs.

### Exercise 1

First, we need to access the US Census API. We will do this by using the **tidycensus** package. This will allow us to use an API key to then access Census data.

###

Load the **tidycensus** package into your R session using `library(tidycensus)`. You may have to install the package before loading it in.

###

Run `search()` in the Console to see the libraries that you've currently loaded, then copy and paste the command and the result into the space below. 

```{r api-access-1}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

###

The output should include the string "package:tidycensus" in the output. This will be the main package that we are going to use to access the US Census, as it allows us to use simple R functions without having to use the complicated `GET()` requests described in Chapter 3.

### Exercise 2

Now that we have the package needed to access the Census database, we need to get an API key. 

An API key is basically a password for an API, but it often comes with certain restrictions. For example, the Census only allows you to collect 50 variables (or columns) from a database at a time. 

###

First, visit [https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html) and request an API key. Use your school or other organization name for the `Organization Name` field. Then, follow the steps and verify your API key through the email that it sends.

###

Copy and paste your API key into the box below. If you don't want to share your API key, change a few letters to make it invalid.

```{r api-access-2}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

###

While an API key isn't mandatory for accessing the Census, it allows you to do more requests and use multiple computers to collect data. It's also a necessity for using the `tidycensus` package.

### Exercise 3

You may remember putting your GitHub Personal Access Token into your `.Renviron` file for safekeeping. We'll be doing the same for our Census API key, but the process looks a little bit different.

###

The **tidycensus** package makes the process much simpler. Run `census_api_key("YOUR API KEY HERE", install = TRUE)` in the Console, substituting your API key in the field.

This should save your key into your `.Renviron` file.

###

Run `Sys.getenv("CENSUS_API_KEY")` in the Console. Copy-paste the command and the output in the space below. If you are nervous about sharing your Census API key, feel free to change it after your copy/paste it into the answer.

```{r api-access-3}
question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 2)
```

###

This should contain your Census API key. If you want to see where the key is stored, run `usethis::edit_r_environ()` in the Console. It should open up your `.Renviron` file and show you all of the keys that you have stored there so far.

###

## Getting data from the Census API
###

The Census API works by accessing Census databases and tables. We can find these tables by visiting [data.census.gov](data.census.gov). For this tutorial, we'll be using the **American Community Survey** and the **Decennial Census**.

###

If you want to see all supported Census tables, please visit [here](https://api.census.gov/data.html). 

If you want to learn more about how the Census API is structured, please look at the official documentation [here](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/data/developers/api-user-guide/api-guide.pdf).

### Exercise 1

Let's try accessing the American Community Survey database. In order to do this, we'll use the `get_acs()` function with the `geography`, `variables`, and `year` arguments.

### 

The geography argument determines the scope of the data (such as `us` for the entire country and `county` for counties), the `year` argument defines the year the data was accessed and the `variables` argument defines which variables you want to use.

###

<!-- AG: 
I think that the Primer is incorrect here. It shows a method for finding table
IDs rather than variable names by going through data.census.gov. However, this
seems to provide a table ID instead of a variable ID, and you can see their
differences here:
https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2019/acs/acs_summary-file_handbook_2019_ch03.pdf.
As of right now, it seems like the only method to access variable names is
through an API request.
-->

<!-- DK: Please fix the Primer. -->

Let's try to find the total American population. First of all, we need to access the variable containing that population. We can do this by using the `load_variables()` function.

###

Run the `load_variables()` function below, setting the `year` argument to 2010 and the `dataset` argument to `"acs5"`.

```{r download-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r download-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
load_variables(year    = ...,
               dataset = ...)
```

###

This should show all of the variables that the **A**merican **C**ommunity **S**urvey (ACS) has as well as a brief explanation as to what they actually mean.

As you can see, the first row of the table is the "UNWEIGHTED SAMPLE COUNT OF THE POPULATION", as shown by the `concept` column. That means that the population count is stored within the `B00001_001` variable. Let's try accessing the data under that variable.

### Exercise 2

Now that we have our variable name, we need to use it in our code.

###

Run the `get_acs()` function below and set the `geography` argument to `"us"`, the `year` argument to `2010`, and the `variables` argument to a string containing the variable that we just found.

```{r download-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r download-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
get_acs(geography = ...,
        year      = ...,
        variables = ...)
```

###

This returns a tibble with the geography, the name of the area described, the variable, and the estimate of the total population.

### Exercise 3

But variables contain a lot more information than just that. They also contain information about the different geographies located within that region. Think about each variable as a classification for different information. A variable about population includes information about the population at every level and at every scope.

###

Run the `get_acs()` function again, setting the `geography` argument to `"state"`, the `year` argument to `2010`, and the `variables` argument to a string containing the variable that we used earlier.

```{r download-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r download-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
get_acs(geography = ...,
        year      = ...,
        variables = ...)
```

### 

As you can see, variables contain a lot of different information at a lot of different levels. 

The GEOID column contains the FIPS code of the area the data covers. This code is a standardized way to identify the different areas and gets larger as the scope narrows down. You can learn more about FIPS codes [here](https://transition.fcc.gov/oet/info/maps/census/fips/fips.txt#:~:text=FIPS%20codes%20are%20numbers%20which,to%20which%20the%20county%20belongs.).

## Graphing Census data
###

Now that we've successfully accessed a variable name and the information contained within it, let's try graphing the ratio of rural population to the actual population for every state.

### Exercise 1

First, let's try to access the Decennial Census. The Decennial Census is conducted every 10 years and is the survey that the Census Bureau was established for in the first place.

###

Run the `load_variables()` function, setting the `year` argument to `2010` and the `dataset` argument to `"sf1"`.

```{r graphing-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r graphing-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
load_variables(year    = ...,
               dataset = ...)
```

###

This returns all of the variables that the Decennial Census uses. The `"sf1"` dataset contains the summary files for the Decennial Census, so we can look at it in order to see all of the variables used by the Census Bureau.

### Exercise 2

This returned a lot of information, but it's a little harder to find what we actually need. In this case, we need to find the actual population variable and the rural population so that we can determine the final ratio.

###

We can do this by using a standard `filter()` command like we did with tidyverse. 

###

Pipe the `load_variables()` function into a `filter()` command that filters the `concept` so that it is only `"URBAN AND RURAL"` and filters the `name` so that it contains the letter `"P"`.

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r graphing-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r graphing-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
load_variables(year    = ...,
               dataset = ...) %>%
  filter(context == ... & grepl(..., ...))
```


###

This filters the variables so that it only has data about the urban and rural populations. Since we want the amount of the population that's rural, we're variable `P002005` since it's named `Total!!Rural` and as such describes the rural populations.

### Exercise 3

Now that we have our variable names, let's actually load in our data. We can do this using the `get_decennial()` function, which is very similar to the `get_acs()` function that we used earlier.

###

This time, we need to get data from 2 variables: The total population ("P001001") and the rural population ("P002005"). 

###

Run the `get_decennial()` function, setting the `geography` argument to `"state"`, the `year` argument to `2010`, the `variables` argument to a vector containing these two variable IDs, and the `output` argument to `"wide"`. 

```{r graphing-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r graphing-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
get_decennial(geography = ...,
              variables = c(..., ...),
              year      = ...,
              output    = "wide")
```

###

By setting the `output` argument to wide, we make the variables their own columns, much like the `pivot_wider()` function. If you don't set the `output` argument to wide, a `variable` column containing the variable name will be created instead.

### Exercise 4

Let's create the following plot using this data.

```{r}
# Including this in the tutorial instead of in the setup chunk because the
# students aren't supposed to be able to access it.

rural_graph <- rural %>%
                 mutate(prop_rural = P002005/P001001) %>% 
                 ggplot(aes(x = prop_rural, y = fct_reorder(NAME, prop_rural))) +
                   geom_point() +
                   labs(title    = "Rural Population in US States in 2010",
                        subtitle = "Maine and Vermont are the most rural states",
                        caption  = "Source: US Census",
                        x        = "Rural Population Proportion",
                        y        = NULL) +
                   theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 5))

rural_graph
```

###

Save the previous output to a variable named `rural` so that we can start out graph.

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r graphing-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r graphing-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
rural <- ...
```

###

We'll be using this value to create a graph and save our data.

### Exercise 5

Start a new pipe using `rural` and add a column containing the ratio between P002005 and P001001.

```{r graphing-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r graphing-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
rural %>%
  mutate(prop_rural = ...)
```

### Exercise 6

Continue the pipe and use the `ggplot()` function to create a graph. Map the `x` argument to the ratio and the `y` argument to `NAME`, then add a `geom_point()` layer.

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r graphing-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r graphing-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ..., y = ...)) +
    geom_point()
```

###

This should show all of the states and their rural population proportion in alphabetical order.

### Exercise 7

Let's sort the states by their rural population. Change the `y` argument to reorder the names based on the rural population ratio.

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r graphing-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r graphing-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ..., y = fct_reorder(..., ...))) +
    geom_point()
```

### Exercise 8

Now let's add the labels to the graph.

As a reminder, here's what the graph should look like:

```{r}
rural_graph
```
###

Additionally, continue the pipe and add the function `theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 5))` in order to shrink the size of the labels and let them all fit onto the graph.

###

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r graphing-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r graphing-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  labs(title    = ...,
       subtitle = ...,
       caption  = ...,
       x        = ...,
       y        = ...)
```

###

Now that we've looked at American Community Survey and Decennial Census data, let's look at PUMS data.

## PUMS data
###

**P**ublic **U**se **M**icrodata **S**amples, or **PUMS** data, contains advanced census data on individual people. While it only contains data for about 1% of the US, it's extremely deep and lets you do a lot of cool things.

### Exercise 1

While this may seem intimidating, PUMS is largely the same as the previous functions with a few small differences. 

###

Run the `glimpse()` function on the dataset `pums_variables` to see what each of the variables represents.

```{r pums-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r pums-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
pums_variables
```

###

The `pums_variables` dataset is automatically constructed by the **tidycensus** package and contains a large amount of information, with 31,759 different variables.

### Exercise 2

Let's try to collect the age, sex, and income data for every single person in PUMS. The `AGEP` variable is for age, the `FINCP` variable is for income, and the `SEX` variable is the sex.

###

We can do this by using the `get_pums()` function. Run the `get_pums()` function, setting the `variables` argument to the ones described above, `state` to your state's name, `recode` to `TRUE`, and `survey` to `"acs1"`.

```{r pums-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r pums-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
get_pums(variables = c(..., ..., ...),
         state     = ...,
         recode    = TRUE,
         survey    = "acs1")
```

###

If you wanted to import data from the entire United States, you can set the `state` argument to `state.name`. Keep in mind that this is all 3 million participants in the PUMS program, so it takes up a large amount of space (over 100 megabytes).

The `recode` argument transforms numerical ID codes into human-readable strings, with columns like `ST` holding the FIPS code while `ST_label` has the actual name of the state.

### Exercise 3


Let's try graphing the percent of PUMS participants below the poverty line in Illinois.

Here's what your graph should look like.

<!-- All of these hide stuff so I'm using them all. It's lazy but it works. -->

```{r, results='hide', warning=FALSE}
il_graph <- il_pums %>%
              group_by(PUMA) %>%
              summarize(total_pop  = sum(PWGTP),
                        pct_income = sum(PWGTP[FINCP < 12880]) / total_pop,
                        .groups    = "drop") %>%
              ggplot(aes(x = pct_income, y = fct_reorder(PUMA, pct_income))) +
              geom_point() +
              labs(title    = "Poverty in Illinois PUMA Zones in 2019",
                   subtitle = "PUMA zones in Will County and Kane County have the lowest poverty rates.",
                   x        = "Poverty Population Percentage",
                   y        = "PUMA Zone Code") +
              theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 3))

il_graph
```

###

First we need to load our data. Run `get_pums()`, setting the `variables` argument to `"PUMA"` and `"FINCP"`, the `state` to Illinois, `recode` to `TRUE`, the `survey` to `"acs1"`, and the year to 2019. Save this to the `il_pums` variable.

```{r pums-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r pums-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
il_pums <- get_pums(variables = c(..., ...),
                    state     = ...,
                    recode    = TRUE,
                    survey    = "acs1",
                    year      = ...)
```

### Exercise 4

Second, we need to filter and group the different people by their PUMA zones so that we can talk about the things done over the entire population.

###

Start a new pipe with `il_pums` and group it by the `PUMA` column.

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r pums-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r pums-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
il_pums %>%
  group_by(PUMA)
```

### Exercise 5

Now let's use those groups and summarize the entire population by their income. 

###

Continue the pipe with the `summarize()` function, creating a column named `total_pop` that contains the sum of `PWGTP`.

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r pums-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r pums-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>%
  summarize(total_pop = sum(...))
```

###

The `PWGTP` column is the number of people contained within that sample, so if you total all of the `PWGTP` column then you can get the total population within the study.

### Exercise 6

We just totaled the population, but now we need to add the income information. 

###

Within the `summarize()` function, add a new column called `pct_income`. This column should include the sum of all the elements of `PWGTP` that have a `FINCP` less than `12880`, then divide it by the total population.

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r pums-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r pums-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>%
  summarize(total_pop  = sum(...),
            pct_income = sum(PWGTP[... < ...]) / ...)
```

###

This gets the percentage of people below the poverty line. It's also advisable to drop the groups after the `summarize()` in order to avoid conflicts later down the road.

### Exercise 7

Continue the pipe with a `ggplot()`, mapping the `x` to `pct_income` and the `y` to `PUMA`. Then add a `geom_point()` layer in order to display the point graph.

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r pums-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r pums-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ..., y = ...)) +
  geom_point()
```

### Exercise 8

Let's sort the zones by their poverty rates. Change the `y` argument to reorder the names based on the rural population ratio.

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r pums-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r pums-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ..., y = fct_reorder(..., ...))) +
    geom_point()
```

### Exercise 9

Now let's add the labels to the graph.

As a reminder, here's what the graph should look like:

```{r}
rural_graph
```
###

Additionally, continue the pipe and add the function `theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 3))` in order to shrink the size of the labels and let them all fit onto the graph.

###

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r pums-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r pums-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  labs(title    = ...,
       subtitle = ...,
       caption  = ...,
       x        = ...,
       y        = ...)
```

###

If you want to see what PUMA zones correlate to what counties, you can visit the [interactive map](https://iecam.illinois.edu/maps/public-use-microdata-areas-pumas/) or the [Census Bureau documentation](https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-maps/2010/geo/2010-pumas/illinois.html).

## IPUMS data

<!-- AG: With the introduction of IPUMS, there's a small conundrum. You need to download absolutely massive files if you want to use IPUMS (3199967 rows! 280.8 MB! 13 columns!), which makes it fundamentally incompatible with the tutorials. As such, I'm making this a separate project that they then publish, kind of like a final project. This is also a great time to walk them through dealing with large files through .gitignore.-->

IPUMS, or the **I**ntegrated **P**ublic **U**se **M**icrodata **S**eries, is a great source for big data. 

It includes the Current Population Survey (CPS) from the U.S. Census as well as other health and housing data. 

This allows you to create a subset of these massive repositories of collected data that fits your needs and interests.

###

An initial word of caution to those new to the system is that your requests are not filled immediately, so **start early!**

You may have to pause the tutorial while you wait for your account to be approved.

### Exercise 1

We're going to be publishing our graph to an RPubs website, so we need to create a new GitHub repo and R project.

###

Create a new GitHub repo named "ipums-graph" and link it to an RStudio project. Make sure to edit `.gitignore` to ignore the `.Rproj` file.

###

Then create a new R Markdown file titled "IPUMS_Graph". Then save the file and name it "index.Rmd".

###

Run `list.files()` in the Console to list all of the files within your project. Copy and paste the output into the space below.

```{r ipums-data-1}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "answer here",
	answer(NULL,
	correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

###

This will be the file that we're coding in for the rest of this tutorial. Knit the file first to make sure that it's all up and running.

### Exercise 2

Delete all of the text other than the YAML header and setup chunk in `index.Rmd`.

###

Then load the packages **tidyverse** and **ipumsr** into the setup chunk using the `library()` command. We're going to be using these packages throughout the rest of this tutorial.

###

Run `readLines("index.Rmd") %>% tail(15)` in the Console to list the last 15 lines in `index.Rmd`. Copy and paste the output into the space below.

```{r ipums-data-2}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "answer here",
	answer(NULL,
	correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

###

The **ipumsr** package is an easy way to import IPUMS data. You can learn more about it [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ipumsr/vignettes/ipums.html).

### Exercise 3

Now that we have our project ready, we need to actually download our data. We'll do this by directly downloading from the IPUMS website and manually generating a request.

###

Start at the [IPUMS home page](https://ipums.org/) and select the survey you wish to explore via the 'visit site' option.

```{r, echo = FALSE, output.width = "500px"}
knitr::include_graphics("IPUMS/images/step_1visit_site.png")
```

From here you will see a prompt to login or register at the very top of the widow:

```{r, echo = FALSE, output.width = "500px"}
knitr::include_graphics("IPUMS/images/login_pt1_02.png")
```

###

If you have used IPUMS before, then you may proceed to login and move on to select your data. However, if you are a new user, you will need to apply for access. The register tab will ask you for standard account creation information.

###

You should list Harvard University as your institution, undergraduate as your occupation, and statistics as your research area. Make sure to state that you are completing the Primer as part of your research statement. Otherwise just use your normal email and don't fill in the optional fields like your occupation title.

###

There are a handful of data use agreements you will be required to agree to in this process which you should note specifically with regard to citations.

Once you have applied, you will need to await the confirmation of your account to log in fully.

###

The official slogan of IPUMS is **Use it for GOOD -- never for EVIL** and it's even included in the terms and conditions.

As such, we're now contractually obligated to use IPUMS for good things.

<!-- screw programming i should be a standup comedian. my stand up show would be a genocide -->

### Exercise 4

Once you receive the email confirmation and logged in properly, you'll be able to start selecting and importing your data.

###

Let's try to recreate the following graph:

<!-- AG: This is a poor imitation of the graph in the Primer, I would like the source code for it since this graph is hacky and stupid, plus I'm not sure if I used the right theme. -->

```{r, out.width="875px"}
include_graphics("images/ipums_plot.png")
```

###

The first option you will need to consider and specify will be the samples (see 'select samples' button), or time the period covered by your data. By default, all of the data from all possible years is selected, but that's obviously way too much data for our purposes.

###

We only need to read in the data for the year 2019, so change the sample to only use 2019 ACS data.

```{r, out.width="875px"}
include_graphics("images/sample_select.gif")
```

###

Keep in mind that we only want 2019 ACS data, not ACS5 data. ACS5 is a 5 year survey that includes all of the data from the past 5 years, which in this case would be 2014-2019.

### Exercise 5

When you submit your sample, you'll be redirected to the variable selection page.

###

You can see below that the household and person tabs (highlighted) will provide a drop down of common variables from this repository under the respective classifications. To add a variable to your ‘cart’ you simply select the + icon, if not available either there is a corresponding explanation or it simply isn’t available.

```{r, out.width="875px"}
include_graphics("images/var_selection_01.png")
```

###

You can also search for variables. In this case, we want the 'INCTOT' and 'EMPSTAT' variables to get the income of a person and their employment status.

Find those variables and add them into your cart.

### Exercise 6

Click "View Cart" to show your cart. Here, you can review and revise your selections in the cart menu prior to requesting the ‘pull.’ 

###

Shown below is what the cart review window should show. An X indicates the existence of data in the given time period. Note that since we're only pulling from one year, we only have data for the 2019 ACS.

```{r}
include_graphics("images/cart_02.png")
```

###

The cart also has a large amount of preselected variables. These are mandatory, but they contain a large amount of information such as the year and the serial number of the data.

### Exercise 7

When you are satisfied with the sample specifications, you can proceed to the create data extract page. 

###

This will provide you with a handful of final options and a text window to describe the sample you’ve created. You should treat this like a commit message in GitHub - brief and meaningful.

Look at the "ESTIMATED SIZE" field. This file is a _massive_ 287.3 MB, or about 1,673 copies of Tales of Beedle the Bard.

Unrecognizable references aside, this is an important fact that you should keep in mind later on.

###

Submitting your request should automatically bring you to the request history page associated with your account. You should note that your requests will only be available for 72 hours, and you should make sure to promptly download your information upon receipt.

```{r}
include_graphics("images/request_history_01.jpg")
```

###

Download the `.dat` file, the DDI Codebook, and the R Command file from the request page. 

You will need to first download the data via Download.DAT, then you will need to save the DDI and R links (via ‘save as’) in the same location as your .dat.gz file. Then relocate these files into your R project.

###

Here's a full GIF of the process:

```{r, out.width="875px"}
include_graphics("images/full_demo.gif")
```

###

Run `list.files()` in the Console to list all of the files within your project. Copy and paste the output into the space below.

```{r ipums-data-8}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "answer here",
	answer(NULL,
	correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

###

We finally have all of our files in R, but there's a few things missing before we can start.

### Exercise 8

Our data file is currently _compressed_ in a `.gz` folder, which needs to be unzipped.

###

Download [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html), a free unzipping program, and unzip the `dat.gz` file. Extract all of the files from the file, then pull the file out of the resulting folder and place it into your general R project.

###

Run `list.files()` in the Console to list all of the files within your project. Copy and paste the output into the space below.

```{r ipums-data-8}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "answer here",
	answer(NULL,
	correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

###

A `.gz` file is a compressed folder much like a ZIP file, reducing the file size. You can learn more about `.gz` files [here](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-gz-file/).

### Exercise 9

Now that we finally have our data downloaded, let's create our graph.

###

First, let's bring our data out of the file and into our R project. Add the line `source(usa_00001.R)` to the setup chunk of `index.Rmd`.

###

Run `readLines("index.Rmd") %>% tail(15)` in the Console to list the last 15 lines in `index.Rmd`. Copy and paste the output into the space below.

```{r ipums-data-9}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "answer here",
	answer(NULL,
	correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

###

The `source()` command runs an R file at the very beginning of the R Markdown command, which is extremely useful for a case like this where we have our R code already written for us.

When you run the `source(usa_00001.R)` command, it should load the `ddi` and `data` objects. Try running `view(data)` to see all of the data that we just imported from PUMS. It should have over 3 million rows, making it decidedly "big" data.

### Exercise 10

So let's start graphing.

###

Start a pipe with data and select the `INCTOT` and `EMPSTAT` columns.

###

Run `readLines("index.Rmd") %>% tail(15)` in the Console to list the last 15 lines in `index.Rmd`. Copy and paste the output into the space below.

```{r ipums-data-10}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "answer here",
	answer(NULL,
	correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

###

These are the only columns that we need, and they're the variables that we asked for in our requests.

### Exercise 11

Now if we look closely at our `data` object, we'll see that there are a few columns with the `haven_labelled` datatype. While this is useful for other languages like Stata, it's pretty useless in R.

###

Continue the pipe and create a new column named `incstat` that contains `INCSTAT` as an integer. Then create another column named `empstat` that contains `EMPSTAT` as a factor.

###

Run `readLines("index.Rmd") %>% tail(15)` in the Console to list the last 15 lines in `index.Rmd`. Copy and paste the output into the space below.

```{r ipums-data-11}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "answer here",
	answer(NULL,
	correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

###

To learn more about Haven labelled variables, please visit the [Primer](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/ipums.html#haven-labelled-variables).

### Exercise 12

Now, you may have seen that when you opened the "DDI" file from the original request link, it looked something like this:

```{r}
include_graphics("images/xml_view.png")
```

###

This is because the `.xml` file contains *metadata*, or information about your imported data. And we can read through that information to find out what we need to use. For example, the metadata about the `EMPSTAT` variable looks like this:

```{r}
include_graphics("images/variable_view.png")
```

We can use the categories to format our data.

###

Change the `empstat` column to replace the numbers with the strings shown above. Use the `case_when()` function to replace `0` with `"NA"`, `1` with `"Employed"`, `2` with `"Unemployed"`, and `3` with `"Not in labor force"`.

###

Run `readLines("index.Rmd") %>% tail(15)` in the Console to list the last 15 lines in `index.Rmd`. Copy and paste the output into the space below.

```{r ipums-data-12}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "answer here",
	answer(NULL,
	correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

###

### Exercise 13


```{r ipums-data-13}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "answer here",
	answer(NULL,
	correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

###

### Exercise 14


```{r ipums-data-14}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "answer here",
	answer(NULL,
	correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```
