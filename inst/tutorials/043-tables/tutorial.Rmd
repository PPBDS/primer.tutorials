## Introduction
### 

The key function/packages used to create tables are [`kable()`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/kable.html) (within the **knitr** package), [**gt**](https://gt.rstudio.com), [**gtsummary**](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/), and [**reactable**](https://glin.github.io/reactable/).

## kable
### 

The **knitr** package "provides a general-purpose tool for dynamic report generation in R using [Literate Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) techniques."  `kable()` is a function in **knitr** for [making tables](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/kable.html).

By the end of this section you will create a table that looks like this:

```{r}
kable_t <- nominate %>% 
  
  # This data was chosen arbitrarily to create a decently sized table. 
  
  arrange(name) %>% 
  filter(congress == 1, chamber == "Senate", party == "Anti-Administration") %>% 
  select(name, born, died, state, nominate_dim1, nominate_dim2) %>% 
  kable(col.names = c("Name", "Year of Birth", "Year of Death", 
                      "State", "Ideological Position on Economic Matters", 
                      "Ideological Position on Societal Matters"),
        align = "l", 
        caption = "Sample of Nominate Data of Senate Members from the First Congress")

kable_t
```

### Exercise 1

Load the **knitr** library.

```{r kable-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r kable-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
library(knitr)
```

### 

### Exercise 2

We will use the data in `nominate` in this section. Run `glimpse()` on `nominate` to learn about the variables.

```{r kable-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r kable-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
glimpse(nominate) 
```

### 

`nominate` is a data set that provides information on Congressional roll call votes in the United States from the first U.S. Congress in 1789 to the `r max(nominate$congress)`th  Congress.

### Exercise 3

Start a pipe with `nominate`. Continue it with `arrange()` to sort the data set alphabetically by `name`

```{r kable-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r kable-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  arrange(...)
```

### 

`nominate` includes votes from the Senate, the President of the United States, and the House of Representatives.

### Exercise 4

Continue the pipe and `filter()` the data to show only observations where `congress == 1`, `party == "Anti-Administration"`and `chamber == "Senate"`.

```{r kable-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r kable-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
filter(congress == ..., chamber = "...")
```

### 

`nominate` includes indicators of politicians' ideological positions, which have been estimated using \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOMINATE_(scaling_method)}{NOMINATE}.

### Exercise 5

Continue the pipe and `select()` the `name`, `born`, `died`, `state`, `nominate_dim1`, `nominate_dim2` columns.

```{r kable-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r kable-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  select(...)
```

### 

### Exercise 6

Continue the pipe with `kable()` to create a table.

```{r kable-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r kable-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  kable()
```

### 

The output should look like this:

```{r}
nominate %>% 
  arrange(name) %>% 
  filter(congress == 1, chamber == "Senate", party == "Anti-Administration") %>% 
  select(name, born, died, state, nominate_dim1, nominate_dim2) %>% 
  kable()
```

### Exercise 7

Within `kable()`, set the value of the `col.names` argument to:

```
c("Name", "Year of Birth", "Year of Death", 
  "State", "Ideological Position on Economic Matters", 
  "Ideological Position on Societal Matters")
```

```{r kable-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r kable-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  kable(col.names = c("Name", "Year of Birth", "Year of Death", 
                      "State", "Ideological Position on Economic Matters", 
                      "Ideological Position on Societal Matters"))
```

### Exercise 8

Add another argument to `kable()` that assigns "l" to `align`. This will left-align the data.

```{r kable-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r kable-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  kable(...,
        align = "l")
```

### 

You can assign "c" or "r" to `align` if you want to center-align or right-align the data.

### 

You can individually align specific columns using a list

### 

Your table should now be identical to the one we are aiming to make. Good job!

```{r}
kable_t
```

### 

Note that we are unable to create a good title, cite our source, or easily customize our table even further.

You can create a caption by assigning a string to the caption variable within `kable()`

While kable allows the creation of tables, customization of tables is limited when using this package. Instead we can use a different package that better suits our needs.



## gt
### 

```{r}
include_graphics("images/Dragon-Ball-GT.jpeg")
```

It is time to learn about **gt**

### 

Nope not Dragon Ball GT.

### 

```{r}
include_graphics("images/Ford-GT.jpeg")
```

### 

Not the Ford GT either. 

### 

The **[gt](https://gt.rstudio.com/)** we will learn about is even better than those other ones. Using **gt** you will be able to create better tables. 

### Exercise 1

Load the **[gt](https://gt.rstudio.com/)** library.

```{r gt-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r gt-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
library(...)
```

### 

Thomas Mock's [blog](https://themockup.blog) is another resource that can be [used](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-05-16-gt-a-grammer-of-tables/) to [explore](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-09-04-10-table-rules-in-r/) this package. 


### Exercise 2

Run `?gt` on the next line to get more information about the `gt( )` function. This will give you an idea of what you need to make best use of this function.

```{r gt-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r gt-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
?gt
```

### 

Some other packages we can use to create tables are **gt**, **reactable**, **DT**, **formattable**, and **flextable**.

### 

Now let's make a table! the table we will make will end up looking like this:

```{r}
gt_t <- trains %>%
  select(gender, income, att_end) %>%
  slice(1:5) %>% 
  gt() %>%
    tab_header(title = md("**Observations of Enos Data Sample**"), 
               subtitle = "Gender, Income, and End Attitude from the Trains Data") %>%
    cols_label(gender = "Gender",
               income = "Income", 
               att_end = "End Attitude") %>% 
    tab_source_note("Enos (2014)") %>%
    fmt_currency(columns = c(income), 
                 decimals = 0) 
gt_t
```

### 

The data set that will be used to make this table is the `trains` data set which can be found in **primer.data**.

### Exercise 3

Print the `trains` data set


```{r gt-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r gt-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
trains
```

### 

This shows us the first 10 rows of the data set. At this point we do not know what any of the data means.

### Exercise 4

Look up the help page with `?trains`.

```{r gt-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r gt-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
?trains
```

### 

`?trains` isn't the only way to get more information about a data set. Some other functions are `glimpse(trains)`,  `summary(trains)`, `skim(trains)`, and `View(trains)`. 

### Exercise 5

Start a pipe with the `trains` data set. `select()` the `gender`, `income`, and `att_end` columns.

```{r gt-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r gt-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  select(..., ..., ...)
```

### 

`trains` is a data set that shows individuals' attitudes toward immigration-related policies, both before and after an experiment which randomly exposed a treated group to Spanish-speakers on a Boston commuter train platform.

### Exercise 6

Add `slice()` to the pipe so that only the first 5 rows are displayed

```{r gt-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gt-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  slice(...:...)
```

### 

### Exercise 7

Continue your pipe with `gt()`.

```{r gt-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gt-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  gt()
```

### 

Your output should look like this:

```{r}
trains %>% 
  select(gender, income, att_end) %>%
  slice(1:5) %>% 
  gt()
```

### 

We now have a functional table. Let's make it look like the table we are aiming to make.

A reminder on how that table looks:

```{r}
gt_t
```

### Exercise 8

Add a `title` and `subtitle` to the table by using `tab_header()`.

```{r gt-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gt-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  tab_header(title = "...",
             subtitle = "...")
```

### 

What you have at this point should look like this:

```{r}
trains %>%
    select(gender, income, att_end) %>%
slice(1:5) %>% 
    gt() %>%
    tab_header(title = "Enos Data Observations", 
               subtitle = "Gender, Income, and End Attitude from the Trains Data")
```

### 

Notice how the title is not bold like it is in the table we want to recreate.

### Exercise 9

By default, titles and other text can not be formatted. To format them, wrap the character string in a call to md().

```{r gt-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gt-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
the code to bold text using md() is adding `**` to both ends of the string
```

```{r gt-9-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  tab_header(title = md("**...**"),
             subtitle = "...")
```

### Exercise 10

Change the column names using cols_label()
```{r gt-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gt-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  cols_label(... = "...",
             ... = "...",
             ... = "...")
```

### Exercise 11

Add a caption/cite your source using tab_source_note()

```{r gt-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gt-11-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  tab_source_note("...")
```

### Exercise 12

Part of the caption should be italicized. This can be done by wrapping the character string in a call to md()

```{r gt-12, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gt-12-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
The code to italicize text in md() is adding "*" to both ends of the string
```

```{r gt-12-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  tab_source_note(md("..., *...*"))
```

### Exercise 13

Add dollar signs and commas to the income column using fmt_currency() (if you only want commas, you can use fmt_number()). Put income within c() to indicate that income is a currency, and assign a value of 0 to the decimals argument. Make sure that your table looks like the table we are aiming to make.

```{r gt-13, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r gt-13-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  fmt_currency(c(...), decimals = ...)
```

Remember, your final table should look like

```{r}
gt_t
```

## nhanes
### 

Let's make a new table using a different data set to make sure we understand how to effectively use `gt`

### 

The table we will be making will look like this:

```{r}
nhanes_t <- nhanes %>% 
  # This data was chosen arbitrarily so that the table was of decent size
  filter(survey == 2011, gender == "Female", age > 50, race == "Mexican") %>% 
  drop_na() %>%
  select(hh_income, age, sleep, general_health) %>% 
  arrange(age) %>% 
  arrange(hh_income) %>% 
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(title = md("**Relationship between Household Income, Sleep and General Health in Mexican Women who are over 50 years old**"),
             subtitle = "Those who make over 75,000 seem to have the best General Health") %>% 
  cols_label(hh_income = "Household Income",
             age = "Age",
             sleep = "Sleep (in hours)",
             general_health = "General Health") %>% 
  tab_source_note(md("*National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2011*")) %>% 
  # This is in a footnote because it is needed to understand the table
  tab_footnote(footnote = "General Health is ranked on a scale of 1-5 where 1 is \"poor\" health, 2 is \"fair\", 3 is \"good\", 4 is \"very good\", and 5 is \"excellent\".", locations = cells_column_labels(column = general_health))
# Color would be cool to add but seems impossible without functions
nhanes_t
```

### Exercise 1

Run `nhanes` to load in the data set.

```{r nhanes-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r nhanes-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
nhanes
```

### 

We don't know what any of this data is yet.

### Exercise 2

Run `?nhanes` data set to get more information about it.

```{r nhanes-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r nhanes-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
?nhanes
```

### 

From this we learn that `nhanes` contains data from The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) research survey. The survey examines health and nutritional status nationwide.

### Exercise 3

Start a pipe with `nhanes`. Continue the pipe to `filter()` so that the data only contains rows where `year` is `2011`, `gender` is `"Female"`, `age` is greater than `50`, and `race` is `"Mexican"`.

```{r nhanes-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nhanes-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
nhanes %>% 
  filter(survey == ..., gender == "...", age > ..., race == "...")
```

### 

These restrictions were chosen arbitrarily so that our end table is of manageable size.

### Exercise 4

Continue the pipe with `drop_na()` to drop all the rows with any missing values

```{r nhanes-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nhanes-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  drop_na()
```

### 

`nhanes` is a unique data set as the surveyors conducts both interviews and physical examination to produce their data.

### Exercise 5

Continue the pipe and `select()` the `hh_income`, `age`, `sleep`, `general_health` columns.

```{r nhanes-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nhanes-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  select(..., ..., ..., ...)
```

### 

The survey is run by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), a part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.


### Exercise 6

Continue the pipe and `arrange()` the data by `age`.

```{r nhanes-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nhanes-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  arrange(...)
```

### Exercise 7

Continue the pipe and `arrange()` the data by `hh_income`

```{r nhanes-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nhanes-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  arrange(...)
```

### 

The reason why we arranged the data twice is so that the second column is also aesthetically pleasing and easy to understand.

### 

What you have at this point should look like this:

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  filter(survey == 2011, gender == "Female", age < 50, race == "Mexican") %>% 
  drop_na() %>%
  select(hh_income, age, sleep, general_health) %>% 
  arrange(age) %>% 
  arrange(hh_income)
```

### Exercise 8

Continue the pipe with `gt()`

```{r nhanes-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nhanes-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  gt()
```

### 

This created a basic table from our manipulated data



### Exercise 9

add a `title` and `subtitle` using the `tab_header()` function. Remember that to bold the title you need to use the `md()` function

```{r nhanes-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nhanes-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
the code to bold text using md() is adding `**` to both ends of the string
```

```{r nhanes-9-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  tab_header(title = "**...**",
             subtitle = "...")
```

### Exercise 10

Continue the pipe to add labels for the columns. Use `col_label()` and change the labels for `hh_income`, `age`, `sleep`, `general_health`. 

```{r nhanes-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nhanes-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  cols_label(hh_income = ...,
             age = ...,
             sleep = ...,
             general_health = ...)
```

### Exercise 11

Continue the pipe to add a footnote (using `tab_footnote()`) which will indicate how `general_health` is ranked. assign the footnote to the `footnote` parameter, and assign the `cells_column_labels()` function to location. Within `cells_column_labels()` set the column to `general_health`. This adds the footnote to the header.

```{r nhanes-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nhanes-11-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
To make quotation marks appear, add a "\" before the "
```

```{r nhanes-11-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  tab_footnote(footnote = "...",
               cells_column_labels(column = ...))
```

### 

The information added to the footnote can be found in the help page for the `nhanes` data set



### Exercise 12

Continue the pipe to include the source of the data. use `tab_source_note()` and use  `md()` to italicize the source information.

```{r nhanes-12, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r nhanes-12-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
the code to italicize text using md() is adding `*` to both ends of the string
```

```{r nhanes-12-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  tab_source_note(md("*...*"))
```

### 

Congratulations, you should now have created a table that looks like this:

```{r}
nhanes_t
```

## regression tables
### 

**gtsummary** is a package that can be used to summarize data and tibbles and is useful in creating regression tables. A regression table shows how closely the relationship between independent variable(s) and a dependent variable is.

Don't worry too much if you don't understand the data within the table you create. You will learn more about it if you decide to pursue post secondary education in math.

### Exercise 1

load in the **gtsummary** package.
```{r regression-tables-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r regression-tables-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
library(gtsummary)
```

### 

Let's create a regression table that looks like:

```{r}
m1 <- stan_glm(data = trains, formula = att_end ~ party, refresh = 0)

regression1_t <- tbl_regression(m1, 
               intercept = TRUE, 
               estimate_fun = function(x) style_sigfig(x, digits = 2)) %>%
  as_gt() 

regression2_t <- regression1_t %>% 
  tab_header(title = "Regression of Attitudes about Immigration", 
             subtitle = "The Effect of Party on End Attitude") %>%
  tab_source_note(md("Source: Ryan Enos, *Causal Effect of Intergroup 
                        Contact on Exclusionary Attitudes*"))
regression2_t
```

### Exercise 2

I have created the model we will use to create the table and assigned it to `m1`.  run `m1` to view it.

```{r regression-tables-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r regression-tables-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
m1
```

### Exercise 3

Start a pipe with the `tbl_regression()` function. Within `tbl_regression()` assign `m1` to `x`.

```{r regression-tables-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r regression-tables-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...
tbl_regression(...)
```

### Exercise 4

Within `tbl_regression()` assign `TRUE` to `intercept`.


```{r regression-tables-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r regression-tables-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...
tbl_regression(...)
```

### Exercise 5

Within `tbl_regression()` assign `function(x) style_sigfig(x, digits = 2))` to `estimate_fun`.

```{r regression-tables-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r regression-tables-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...
tbl_regression(...)
```

### 

`estimate_fun` allows us to round and format the coefficient estimates provided by `tbl_regression()`

### 

The `function()` function allows us to define new functions.

The `style_sigfig()` function converts a numeric argument to a string that has been rounded to a significant figure-like number.

### Exercise 6

Continue the pipe with `as_gt()`.

```{r regression-tables-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r regression-tables-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...
... %>% 
  as_gt()
```

### 

Currently you should have a simple table that looks like this:

```{r}
regression1_t
```

### Exercise 7

Continue the pipe with `tab_header()` to add a suitable title and subtitle. 

```{r regression-tables-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r regression-tables-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...
... %>% 
  tab_header(...)
```

### Exercise 8

Continue the pipe to add a caption using `tab_source_note`. To properly format the caption, wrap the character string in a call to md(). 

```{r regression-tables-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r regression-tables-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
The code to italicize text in md() is adding "*" to both ends of the string 
```

```{r regression-tables-8-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
...
... %>% 
  tab_source_note(md("Source: Ryan Enos, *Causal Effect of Intergroup 
                        Contact on Exclusionary Attitudes*"))
```

### 

Congrats! You should now have a completed table that looks like:

```{r}
regression2_t
```

## reactable
### 

**[reactable](https://glin.github.io/reactable/)** is a package that allows us to create interactive tables.

### Exercise 1

Load the **[reactable](https://glin.github.io/reactable/)** library.

```{r reactable-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r reactable-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
library(...)
```

Thomas Mock's [blog](https://themockup.blog) is another resource that can be used to [explore](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-05-13-reactable-tables-the-rest-of-the-owl/) this package. 

### Exercise 2

Run `reactable(trains)` to create a very simple table using the data found within the `trains` data set.

```{r reactable-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
reactable(trains)
```

### 

Now, let's create a table that looks like this. 

```{r}
reactable1_t <- trains %>%
  #These filters were chosen arbitrarily to keep the able small
  filter(treatment ==  "Control") %>%
  filter(gender == "Female") %>% 
  filter(age >= 40) %>% 
  # I created these 2 columns because they would look cool in color
  # color was removed because it involved functions to incorporate
  
  mutate(ideology_change = ideology_end - ideology_start, 
         att_change = att_end - att_start) %>% 
  select(gender, age, race, party, att_start, att_end, att_change) %>%
  reactable(pagination = FALSE,
            highlight = TRUE,
            compact = TRUE,
            outlined = TRUE,
            defaultColDef = colDef(align = "left"),
            columns = list(gender = colDef(name = "Gender"),
                           age = colDef(name = "Age"),
                           race = colDef(name = "Race"),
                           party = colDef(name = "Party"),
                           att_start = colDef(name = "Starting Attitude"),
                           att_end = colDef(name = "Ending Attitude"),
                           att_change = colDef(name = "Change in Attitude")))
reactable1_t
```

### 

Note that you can interact with this table!

### Exercise 3

To create this table, we will use the trains data set. run `?trains` to learn more about the data set

```{r reactable-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
?trains 
```

### 

Though there are 2 levels in `treatment`, we will only be making a table for the control group in this set of exercises.

### Exercise 4

Start a pipe with `trains`. Continue the pipe and `filter()` so that the data only contains rows where `treatment == "Control"`, `gender == "Female"`, and `age >= 40`.

```{r reactable-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
trains %>% 
  filter(..., ..., ...)
```

### Exercise 5

Continue the pipe to `select()` the `gender`, `age`, `race`, `party`, `att_start`, and `att_end` columns.


```{r reactable-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
trains %>% 
  select(...)
```

### Exercise 6

Continue the pipe with `reactable()` to create a simple table.

```{r reactable-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  reactable()
```

### Exercise 7

Within `reactable()` assign `FALSE` to `pagination`. This makes the table to display on one page.

```{r reactable-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  reactable(pagination = ...)
```

### 

This is useful when you want all your data to be viewed together.

### Exercise 8

Within `reactable()` assign `TRUE` to `highlight`. This will highlight table rows on hover.

```{r reactable-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  reactable(..., highlight = ...)
```

### 

Another method to make rows more distinguishable is by assigning `TRUE` to `striped` within `reactable()`. This will change the background of every other row.

### Exercise 9

Within `reactable()` assign `TRUE` to `compact`. This makes the table more compact.

```{r reactable-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  reactable(..., compact = ...)
```

### 

This is a good parameter to use if you want a minimalist table.

### Exercise 10

Within `reactable()` assign `TRUE` to `outlined`. This will add borders around the table.

```{r reactable-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  reactable(..., outlined = ...)
```

### Exercise 11

`defaultColDef` is a parameter within `reactable()` that allows us to define the default settings for each column within our table.

Within `reactable()`, assign `colDef(align = "left")` to `defaultColDef`. This will left-align all columns.


```{r reactable-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-11-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  reactable(..., defaultColDef = colDef(align = "left"))
```

### 

`colDef()` is a function that allows us to define what a column will look like in the table.

### Exercise 12

Set the value of the `columns` argument to:

```
list(gender = colDef( name = "Gender"), 
     age = colDef(name = "Age"), 
     race = colDef(name = "Race"), 
     party = colDef(name = "Party"), 
     att_start = colDef(name = "Starting Attitude"), 
     att_end = colDef(name = "Ending Attitude"), 
     att_change = colDef(name = "Change in Attitude"), 
     ideology_start = colDef(name = "Starting Ideology"), 
     ideology_end = colDef(name ="Ending Ideology"),
     ideology_change = colDef(name = "Change in Attitude"))
```

This will rename the columns to more suitable names.

```{r reactable-12, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r reactable-12-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  reactable(..., columns = list(...))
```

### 

Unfortunately there is no way to add a title to your table without using another package, such as **htmlwidgets**, in conjunction with **reactable**.

### 

Congratulations!

You should have now created a table that looks like:

```{r}
reactable1_t 
```

### 

You can make your **reactable** tables even cooler by adding color. Doing this involves content not covered in this course. If you want to learn how to use color in your table check out [this blog post](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-05-13-reactable-tables-the-rest-of-the-owl/) by Thomas Mock

## Summary
### 

To recap the key function/packages used to create tables are [`kable()`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/kable.html) (within the **knitr** package), [**gt**](https://gt.rstudio.com), [**gtsummary**](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/), and [**reactable**](https://glin.github.io/reactable/).

[**kable**](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/kable.html) is a quick and easy way to create a simple table.

[**gt**](https://gt.rstudio.com) allows for more customization and cleaner tables.

[**gtsummary**](http://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/) allows you to create summary tables, and regression tables.

[**reactable**](https://glin.github.io/reactable/) is a package that enable us to create interactive tables. We aren't able to make use of many functions of [**reactable**](https://glin.github.io/reactable/) due to its complexity, but it is still useful nonetheless.
