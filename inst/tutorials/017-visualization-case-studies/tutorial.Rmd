## The US Life Expectancy Gap
### 

We will be making this plot here. This section will be 23 exercises long.

```{r fig.width = 10}
final_plot <- 
  oecd_sum |> 
  drop_na() |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = diff, fill = hi_lo)) +
      geom_col() + 
      guides(fill = "none") +
      theme_minimal() +
      labs(x = NULL, 
           y = "Difference in Years",
           title = "The US Life Expectancy Gap",
           subtitle = "Difference between US and OECD average life expectancies,\n1960-2015",
           caption = "Data: OECD. After a chart by Christopher Ingraham,\nWashington Post, December 27th 2017.") +
      theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold",
                                      size = 20,
                                      margin = margin(b = 5)),
            plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "italic",
                                         size = 15,
                                         margin = margin(b = 10)),
            plot.caption = element_text(face = "italic",
                                        margin = margin(t = 5)),
            axis.title.y = element_text(face = "bold"),
            axis.text = element_text(face = "bold"))

final_plot
```

### Exercise 1

We will first explore the data set we will be using for the first graph. Run `oecd_sum` in the code chunk below.

```{r the-us-life-expectan-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r the-us-life-expectan-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
oecd_sum
```

### 

The data set is from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, otherwise known as OECD. 

### Exercise 2

We will explore the `oecd_sum` data set further. Go onto this website [here](https://kjhealy.github.io/socviz/reference/oecd_sum.html). Copy and paste what the hi_lo and diff variables represent.

```{r the-us-life-expectan-2}
  question_text(NULL,
    answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
    incorrect = NULL,
    rows = 3)
```

### 

This dataset focuses specifically on the USA in relation to OECD stats.

### Exercise 3

We will be building a plot mapping the USA's average life expectancy compared to the OECD's from 1960 to 2015. Start by building a pipe with the data set. Use the function `select()`. Within select, input `-other, -usa`. 

```{r the-us-life-expectan-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r the-us-life-expectan-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
oecd_sum |> 
  select(-other, -usa)
```

We do not need to know the life expectancy in OECD countries or in the US. We simply need to know the difference in life expectancy, which is already calculated for us. 

### Exercise 4

Continue the pipe with ggplot. Within `ggplot()`, set the argument `mapping` to equal `aes()`. Within `aes()`, map `year` to the x-axis and `diff` to the y-axis.

```{r the-us-life-expectan-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r the-us-life-expectan-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
oecd_sum |> 
  select(...) |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = ...,
                       y = ...))
```

### 

Remember: simply mapping variables to the x and y axis will create an empty plot. You must add a geom layer to visualize the data.

### Exercise 5

Continue building your plot. Reminder, since you are building the plot layer by layer, you must use `+`. Within `aes`, set the `fill` argument to `hi_lo`.

```{r the-us-life-expectan-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r the-us-life-expectan-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
oecd_sum |> 
  select(...) |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = ...,
                       y = ...,
                       fill = ...))
```

### 

This will allow the bars to be a different colour if the US' life expectancy is below/above the OECD's.

### Exercise 6

Add the `geom_col()` layer.

```{r the-us-life-expectan-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r the-us-life-expectan-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
oecd_sum |> 
  select(...) |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = ...,
                       y = ...,
                       fill = ...)) +
    geom_col()
```

### 

We choose to use `geom_col()` instead of `geom_bar()` since we already have the math done for how big the difference is between the US's life expectancy and OECD's in the `diff` column.

### Exercise 7

Add the layer `guides(fill = "none")`

```{r the-us-life-expectan-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r the-us-life-expectan-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
oecd_sum |> 
  select(...) |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = ...,
                       y = ...,
                       fill = ...)) +
    geom_col() +
    guides(fill = "none")
```

### 

`guides(fill = "none")` tells ggplot to drop the legend that would be generated automatically when the `fill` argument is used, when we have no need for it. The other way to accomplish this would be to do `theme(legend.position = "none")`.

### Exercise 8

Add the theme `theme_minimal()`.

```{r the-us-life-expectan-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r the-us-life-expectan-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
oecd_sum |> 
  select(...) |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = ...,
                       y = ...,
                       fill = ...)) +
    geom_col() +
    guides(fill = "none") +
    theme_minimal()
```

### 

This is part of the ggplot2 package. Explore the themes on the ggplot2 package [here](https://www.shanelynn.ie/themes-and-colours-for-r-ggplots-with-ggthemr/).

### Exercise 9

Add the `labs()` layer to give your plot the appropriate `title`, `subtitle`, `caption`, etc. Reminder: this is the plot we are trying to create:

```{r}
final_plot
```

```{r the-us-life-expectan-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r the-us-life-expectan-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
oecd_sum |> 
  select(...) |> 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = ...,
                       y = ...,
                       fill = ...)) +
    geom_col() +
    guides(fill = FALSE) +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(title = ...,
         subtitle = ...,
         caption = ...,
         x = ...,
         y = ...)
```

### Exercise 10

Skim through [this documentation here](https://ggplot2-book.org/polishing.html#modifying-theme-components). We will be using these functions to modify the font of the graph and make it bold. What are the four element functions that can be used in `theme()`? 

```{r the-us-life-expectan-10}
question_text(NULL,
	message = "element_text(), element_line(), element_rect(), element_blank()",
	answer(NULL,
	correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = FALSE,
	incorrect = NULL,
	rows = 6)
```

### 

We will primarily be using `element_text()`.

### Exercise 11

Summarize in your own words what the function `element_text()` does.
```{r the-us-life-expectan-11}
question_text(NULL,
	answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
	allow_retry = TRUE,
	try_again_button = "Text for button",
	incorrect = NULL)
```

### 

Note: the only family fonts that will reliably work are "serif", "sans", and "mono". The usage of any other is not guaranteed to work.

### Exercise 12

We will now use `theme(plot.title = ...)` to change the plot title. Set the argument `face` to "bold".

```{r the-us-life-expectan-12, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r the-us-life-expectan-12-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face ="bold")
```

### Exercise 13

Add the `size` argument within `element_text()`. Set the size to 20.

```{r the-us-life-expectan-13, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r the-us-life-expectan-13-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold",
                                  size = 20)
```

### 

This aligns with the typical font sizes you have on your laptop.

### Exercise 14

We will adjust the margins to increase readability. Margins act as a buffer around each individual text block. Add the argument `margin` and then set it to `margin(b = 5)`

```{r the-us-life-expectan-14, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r the-us-life-expectan-14-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = ...,
                                  size = ...,
                                  margin = margin(b = 5))
```

### 

`b` stands for the "bottom" margin. 

### Exercise 15

We will now format the subtitle. Within the big `theme()` function, add a new argument titled `plot.subtitle`. Set it equal to element_text(). Note: there will be an error if you attempt to run this since there is no arguments within element_text().

```{r the-us-life-expectan-15, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r the-us-life-expectan-15-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = ...,
                                  size = ...,
                                  margin = ...),
        plot.subtitle = element_text())
```


### Exercise 16

Add the argument `face` to element_text(). Set it equal to "italic".

```{r the-us-life-expectan-16, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r the-us-life-expectan-16-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...,
plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "italic")
```


### Exercise 17

Change the font size to 15.

```{r the-us-life-expectan-17, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r the-us-life-expectan-17-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...,
plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "italic",
                             size = 15)
```


### Exercise 18

From here, set the bottom margin to 10 to create space between the subtitle and the graph.

```{r the-us-life-expectan-18, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r the-us-life-expectan-18-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...,
plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "italic",
                             size = 15,
                             margin = margin(b = 10))
```

### 

The margin is measured in pixels.

### Exercise 19

We will now modify the caption to make it italic, and also create some space between the caption and the graph. Add the `plot.caption =` argument within `theme()`. Set it to element_text(). 

```{r the-us-life-expectan-19, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r the-us-life-expectan-19-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...,
plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "italic",
                             size = 15,
                             margin = margin(b = 10)),
plot.caption = element_text()
```


### Exercise 20

Make the font italic.

```{r the-us-life-expectan-20, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r the-us-life-expectan-20-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...,
plot.caption = element_text(face = "italic")
```

### Exercise 21

Set the top margin to 5. We do this by using `margin = margin(t = 5)`.

```{r the-us-life-expectan-21, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r the-us-life-expectan-21-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...,
plot.caption = element_text(face = "italic",
                            margin = margin(t = 5))
```

### 

"t" stands for the top margin.

### Exercise 22

We will now simply set the y-axis title to be bold. Add axis.title.y as an argument to theme(). Set it equal to element_text(), and then face = "bold".

```{r the-us-life-expectan-22, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r the-us-life-expectan-22-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
axis.title.y = element_text(face = "bold")
```

### 

Any code that modifies the axes will have the prefix "axis" instead of "plot".

### Exercise 23

Last but not least, we will modify the axes ticks to be bold, so they are more easily readable. Add `axis.text` to within the `theme()` argument. Set it equal to `element_text()`. Make the font bold.

```{r the-us-life-expectan-23, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r the-us-life-expectan-23-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
axis.text = element_text(face = "bold"))
```

Reminder: your final graph should look like this.

```{r}
final_plot
```


## Portland Heatwave in 2021
### 


<!-- HL: I also have no idea why the colour of the dots won't change -->

In July 2021, the US Pacific Northwest and some of Canada's west coast faced some of the most devastating heat they'd seen in history. Over 200 people died (as of July 9th) due to the extreme heat. You can read more about it in [this Guardian article.](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jul/08/pacific-northwest-heatwave-deaths)

### 

The inspiration for this exercise was taken from [this New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/06/29/upshot/portland-seattle-vancouver-weather.html).

```{r}
include_graphics("images/nyt-plot.png")
```

Credits to Cédric Scherer on Twitter for providing the code breakdown of a slightly modified graph. You can find the GitHub code [here](https://gist.github.com/z3tt/275e6cffa5933c85332bacfad717eb88).

###

This section will be 31 exercises long.

### 

The plot that we will be designing is shown below.

```{r}
portland_1 <- ggplot(data = portland_data, 
         mapping = aes(x = yday, 
                       y = tmax)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .05, size = .9) +
  geom_point(data = filter(portland_data, 
                    recent_high != FALSE), 
             mapping = aes(color = "#C1392B"),
             alpha = 1,
             size = 2.3) +
  guides(color = "none") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = months$yday,
                     labels = months$label,
                     expand = c(.01, .01)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x) paste0(x, "°F"), 
                     breaks = seq(from = 20, 
                                  to = 120, 
                                  by = 20)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = NULL, 
       y = NULL, 
       title = "Daily maximum temperatures in Portland, 1979–2021",
       caption = "Data: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration via Oregon Live. \nGraphic: Cédric Scherer.") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face ="bold"),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        axis.line.x = element_line(size = 0.2),
        axis.ticks.x = element_line())

portland_final <- portland_1 + annotate("text",
                                        x = 210,
                                        y = 118,
                                        label = "Last 3 days",
                                        fontface = "bold",
                                        color = "#C1392B")
portland_final
```

### Exercise 1

We will be using the `portland_data` tibble, taken from [Oregon Live Data](https://www.oregonlive.com/data/). The data has been prepared for you. Run `portland_data` in the code chunk below to explore the data set.

```{r portland-heatwave-in-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r portland-heatwave-in-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
portland_data
```

### 

Good! Note: the temperatures are all in Fahrenheit, and `tmax` and `tmin` represent the highest temperature and the lowest temperature for that day.

### Exercise 2

Run `glimpse()` on the portland_data tibble.

```{r portland-heatwave-in-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r portland-heatwave-in-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
glimpse(portland_data)
```

### 

Take a look at the `recent_high` column. It's a logical column that we will later use to filter the data to get the three dots.

### Exercise 3

Take a look at the `months` tibble, we will use it to create breaks on the x-axis. Run `months` in the code chunk below. 

```{r portland-heatwave-in-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r portland-heatwave-in-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
months
```

### 

This `months` tibble contains column `yday`, which indicates what day of the year the months change. The `label` column contains the month name, which we will use to create the breaks in the x-axis. We will use this later on to change the breaks from numbers to months.


### Exercise 4

Let's start building the plot! First, let's use the function `ggplot()`. Within the function, set the argument `data` equal to `portland_data`.

```{r portland-heatwave-in-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r portland-heatwave-in-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = portland_data)
```

### 

Good! This merely tells the plot what dataset to use. We have not told it what to plot yet.

### Exercise 5

Next, let's assign the `x` and `y` variables. Within ggplot, set the `x` variable to `yday` and the `y` variable to `tmax`. Remember to set this within `mapping = aes()` in ggplot. 

```{r portland-heatwave-in-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r portland-heatwave-in-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = portland_data,
       mapping = aes(x = yday,
                     y = tmax))
```

### 

Good! The original plot by the New York Times mapped maximum temperature, so we will use the `tmax` column.

### Exercise 6

Next, we will start adding the scatterplot. Add the layer `geom_point`. Remember to use a `+` sign after the `ggplot` layer.

```{r portland-heatwave-in-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r portland-heatwave-in-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...+
  geom_point()
```

### 

You may notice there's a significant degree of overplotting. We will rectify this in the next exercise. 

### Exercise 7

Within `geom_point`, add the argument alpha and set it to .05. Furthermore, set the argument `size` (still within geom_point) to .9. 

```{r portland-heatwave-in-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r portland-heatwave-in-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...+
  geom_point(alpha = .05,
             size = .9)
```

### 

Since there is around 40 years of data, there will be a significant degree of overplotting. We fixed this by reducing the size of each point and changing the alpha.

### Exercise 8

Now, we want to get the 3 dots that the NYT graphic highlights. We will add another geom_point layer to create those three dots. 

```{r portland-heatwave-in-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r portland-heatwave-in-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  geom_point()
```

### 

Right now, we have simply added another layer which was the exact same as the layer in Exercise 6. We will filter the data specifically for those 3 dots.

### Exercise 9

Within the second `geom_point`, we must filter the data. First, use the argument `data = ...`. Next, within that argument, use `filter()`. The first argument should be `portland_data` (since we are filtering that data set), and then the second argument should be `recent_high != FALSE``.

```{r portland-heatwave-in-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r portland-heatwave-in-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...+
  geom_point(data = filter(portland_data, 
                    recent_high != FALSE))
```

### 

The `recent_high` column has been modified so that `TRUE` columns are true for the recent three temperatures we want to highlight. Therefore, we use != to filter out the rows that have nothing.

### Exercise 10

We will now change the color of those three dots. Within `geom_point()`, add a new argument which set `color` to "#C1392B". 

```{r portland-heatwave-in-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r portland-heatwave-in-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...+
  geom_point(data = filter(portland_data, 
                    recent_high != FALSE),
                    color = "#C1392B")
```

### 

You can use HEX codes in the `color` argument to change it to whatever colour you would like.

### Exercise 11

Next, we'll change the size of these dots to make them stand out more. Set the argument `size` to 2.3.

```{r portland-heatwave-in-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r portland-heatwave-in-11-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...+
  geom_point(data = filter(portland_data, 
                    recent_high != FALSE),
             mapping = aes(color = "#C1392B"),
             size = 2.3)
```

### 

Good! Now you can clearly see these three dots distinct from the other dots in the graph.

### Exercise 12

You may have noticed a legend popping up on the side of your graph. We don't need it, since these three dots don't indicate anything in particular. Add a new layer, `guides()`. Within `guides()`, set `color = "none"`.

```{r portland-heatwave-in-12, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r portland-heatwave-in-12-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  guides(color = "none")
```

### 

The `guides` function allows you to get rid of legends just like an argument within `theme()` would as well.


### Exercise 13

Copy and paste your code from Exercise 12. Add another layer, `scale_x_continuous`. We want to first change the break intervals on the x-axis. Set the argument `breaks` to `months$yday`.

```{r portland-heatwave-in-13, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r portland-heatwave-in-13-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = months$yday)
```

### 

Remember, the `$` operator pulls a vector from a tibble. Since we only care about the `yday` column, we pull that vector from the tibble.

### Exercise 14

Next, we want to change the labels so they display the names of the months. Still within `scale_x_continuous`, add the argument `labels` and set it to `months$label`.

```{r portland-heatwave-in-14, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r portland-heatwave-in-14-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = months$yday,
                     labels = months$label)
```

### 

You may see that it's a little crowded in the axis labels. We will fix that in the next exercise.

### Exercise 15

Still within `scale_x_continuous`, add the argument `expand =`. Set it equal to `c(.01,.01)`

```{r portland-heatwave-in-15, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r portland-heatwave-in-15-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = months$yday,
                     labels = months$label,
                     expand = c(.01, .01))
```

### 

The `expand` argument adds padding around the data to ensure they're placed away from the axes. We added 1% padding. 

### Exercise 16

Now let's fix the y-axis. In the NYT graphic, there are breaks every 20 degrees. Let's make our graph the same way. In `scale_y_continuous`, set the `break` argument equal to `seq(from = 20, to = 120, by = 20)`.

```{r portland-heatwave-in-16, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r portland-heatwave-in-16-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 20, to = 120, by = 20))
```

### 

`seq()` is a function that allows you to generate regular sequences. The first argument, `from` indicates what number the sequence starts from, `to` indicates the last number of the sequence, and `by` indicates the interval of the sequence.

### Exercise 17

Next, we want to add °F to each of the breaks. Including units is important! Within scale_y_continuous, add the `labels` argument.Set the labels argument equal to `function(x) paste0(x, "°F")`.

```{r portland-heatwave-in-17, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r portland-heatwave-in-17-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 20, to = 120, by = 20),
                     labels = function(x) paste0(x, "°F"))
```

### 

When you want to add text to your axis labels without changing the data itself, you can use `labels = function(x)`. The `paste0` function allows you to add strings together. In this case, we asked it to add the temperature and then °F.

### Exercise 18

To simplify the plot, add the layer `theme_minimal()`.

```{r portland-heatwave-in-18, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r portland-heatwave-in-18-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...+
  theme_minimal()
```

### 

Our plot still doesn't look exactly like the New York Times plot. We will modify it to get as close as we can. But first, let's add a title and a caption.

### Exercise 19

Add the `labs()` layer to add a title and a caption. Remember, use `\n` to add a line break. Reminder: the final plot we're aiming for should look like this:

```{r}
portland_final
```

```{r portland-heatwave-in-19, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r portland-heatwave-in-19-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  labs(title = ...,
       subtitle = ...,
       y = ...,
       x = ...)
```

### 

Remember, to get rid of the x and y axis labels, set them equal to `NULL`. 

### Exercise 20

The first thing to fix is the title. We should make it bold, just like we did in the previous exercise. Add the `theme()` layer, and within it set the argument `plot.title` equal to `element_text()`. Within `element_text()`, set `face = "bold"`.

```{r portland-heatwave-in-20, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r portland-heatwave-in-20-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"))
```

### 

Good! Remember "face" changes the font to be either plain, italic, bold, or bold.italic.

### Exercise 21

Next, let's get rid of some grid lines to make it much cleaner. Within theme() still, set `panel.grid.minor` equal to `element_blank()`.

```{r portland-heatwave-in-21, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r portland-heatwave-in-21-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```

### 

Minor grid lines are those that do not have a label attached to them. We got rid of them using `element_blank()`, which causes that particular aspect of the theme to disappear.

### Exercise 22

You may also have noticed that there are no vertical lines running across the graph at all. We will get rid of the x-axis major labels by setting `panel.grid.major.x` equal to `element_blank()`. 

```{r portland-heatwave-in-22, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r portland-heatwave-in-22-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank()) 
```

### 

Somewhat confusingly, "x-axis" lines run vertically, and "y-axis" lines run horizontally. 

### Exercise 23

You may have noticed that when we set `panel.grid.minor` to `element_blank()` the x-axis line disappeared. This is because we have no label at 0 degrees. However, we want an x-axis. Within `theme()` set the argument `axis.line.x` equal to `element_line()`.

```{r portland-heatwave-in-23, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r portland-heatwave-in-23-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        axis.line.x = element_line()) 
```

### 

Remember: `element_line` is one of the four elements in modifying themes, along with `element_text`, `element_blank`, and `element_rect`.

### Exercise 24

The x-axis is a bit too thick and bold. We can reduce the size of the line. Within `element_line()` set the argument `size` equal to 0.2. 

```{r portland-heatwave-in-24, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r portland-heatwave-in-24-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        axis.line.x = element_line(size = 0.2)) 
```

### 

Good! You can modify the size of lines just like you can modify the size of points in geom_point().

### Exercise 25

In the NYT graphic, each month has a little tick on the x-axis. Let's create those! Still within `theme()`, set `axis.ticks.x` equal to element_line(). 

```{r portland-heatwave-in-25, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r portland-heatwave-in-25-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        axis.line.x = element_line(size = 0.2),
        axis.ticks.x = element_line()) 
```

### 

Good! Since the ticks are a line, we use `element_line` to create them.

### Exercise 26

You may notice there is one key element missing, that being the annotation on the plot that has "Last 3 days". We will create this soon. But first, assign your code to a plot object called `portland_graph`. 

```{r portland-heatwave-in-26, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r portland-heatwave-in-26-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
portland_graph <- ggplot(...)
```

### 

Good! Now we can add the annotation layer.

### Exercise 27

Add the function `annotate()` to your plot object `portland_graph`. 

```{r portland-heatwave-in-27, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r portland-heatwave-in-27-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
...

portland_graph + annotate()
```

### 

Note: you will get an error if you attempt to run this. We have not put everything necessary to create an annotation.

### Exercise 28

Within annotate, put "text". This tells R that you want to annotate the plot with text.

```{r portland-heatwave-in-28, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r portland-heatwave-in-28-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
portland_graph + annotate("text")
```

### 

You could also annotate a graph with a rectangle (`"rect"`), a line segment (`"segment"`), or a range (`"pointrange"`).

### Exercise 29

Next, we will set the x and y coordinates for where this label should go. Set the argument `x` equal to 210 and `y` equal to 118.

```{r portland-heatwave-in-29, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r portland-heatwave-in-29-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
portland_graph + annotate("text",
                          x = 210,
                          y = 118)
```

### 

These coordinates are based off the values of the x and y axes. July is roughly around the 200th day of the year, and the top temperature is roughly around 110 degrees Fahrenheit.

### Exercise 30

You may have noticed we don't have any text yet. Within annotate, set the `label` argument equal to "Last 3 days".

```{r portland-heatwave-in-30, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r portland-heatwave-in-30-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
portland_graph + annotate("text",
                          x = 210,
                          y = 118,
                          label = "Last 3 days")
```

### 

Good! Now you should see text.

### Exercise 31

The NYT plot has bold text and the colour of the text matches the colour of the dots. Let's do the same. Within annotate, set `fontface` equal to "bold". Then, set `color` equal to the HEX code you used prior, "#C1392B".

### 

As a reminder, this is what your final plot should look like.

```{r}
portland_final
```

```{r portland-heatwave-in-31, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r portland-heatwave-in-31-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
portland_graph + annotate("text",
                          x = 210,
                          y = 118,
                          label = "Last 3 days",
                          fontface = "bold",
                          color = "#C1392B")
```

### 

These arguments, `fontface` and `color` are the same aesthetic arguments you would use with other geoms in ggplot.
