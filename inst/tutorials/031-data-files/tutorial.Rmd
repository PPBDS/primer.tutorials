# There are two ways to deal with files which we want students to work with
# directly. The first approach, which is what we use here, is to file.copy() the
# file over during the set-up stage. This seems OK, but a bit annoying. The
# second approach would just tell students that the file they are reading in
# lives in data/, so they need to give a relative path like data/test_1.csv.
# Would that be better?

<!-- Add exercise with col_select.  -->

<!-- Exercises about name_repair argument. Show them the "universal" option. -->

<!-- Add a question or two about using janitor:clean_names().  -->

<!-- Then show read_csv("whatever", name_repair = janitor::make_clean_names) -->

<!-- Make use of the copy button, for example in Exercise 5 of CVS files. -->


<!-- Show example, from readr 2.0, if being able to read in more than one identical file in a single command. Need to take the student on a tour of the files first. A similar example:


list.files(…) %>% 
  read_csv(
    name_repair = janitor::make_clean_names
  )

Start with list.files("data")
Then list.files("data", pattern = "similar")
Then list.files("data", pattern = "similar", full.names = TRUE)
Then list.files("data", pattern = "similar", full.names = TRUE) %>% read_csv()
list.files("data", pattern = "similar", full.names = TRUE) %>% read_csv(na = ".")
list.files("data", pattern = "similar", full.names = TRUE) %>% read_csv(na = ".", show_col_types = FALSE)

But that is still a problem, because "b" is read in as character, because of the initial dot.

## CSV Files

### 

"CSV" stands for **c**omma-**s**eparated **v**alues, meaning that the variable names and data values are separated by commas in the file. All the files we will use in this tutorial live in the `data/` directory.


### Exercise 1

Consider the contents of the `test_1.csv` file.

```{r comment = ''}
cat(readLines("data/test_1.csv"), sep = "\n")
```

### 

Write code to read this file into R using read_csv(), and set the `file` argument to "data/test_1.csv".

```{r csv-files-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r csv-files-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
Use read_csv() to read in a csv file. 
Set the `file` argument to "data/test_1.csv".
```

```{r csv-files-1-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
read_csv(file = "data/test_1.csv")
```

### 

The result when your code is run should look like this:

```{r}
read_csv("data/test_1.csv")
```

### 

The column specification message is a suggestion to specify the data types for each column of data. R "guesses" a data type until we use the `col_types` argument. 

### Exercise 2

Make the warning message disappear by setting the `show_col_types` argument to `False`.

```{r csv-files-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r csv-files-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
read_csv(files = "data/test_1.csv",
         show_col_types = ...)
```

###

Your code should look like this after running it:

```{r}
read_csv("data/test_2.csv",
         show_col_types = FALSE)
```

### 

It is often better to use the `col_types` argument explicitly in order to ensure that the variable types are what you want them to be.

### Exercise 3

```{r csv-files-3-setup}
cat(readLines("data/test_1.csv"), sep = "\n")
```

Consider the contents of the `test_2.csv` file. 

```{r comment = ''}
cat(readLines("data/test_2.csv"), sep = "\n")
```

### 

Write code for skipping the text at the top of this file by setting the second argumet `skip` to the appropriate number.

```{r csv-files-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r csv-files-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
In addition to the `file` argument, you will 
need to use the`skip` argument here. Set `skip` 
to 2.
```

```{r csv-files-3-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
read_csv(file = "data/test_2.csv",
          skip = ...)
```

### 

The result when your code is run should look like this:

```{r}
read_csv("data/test_2.csv",
         skip = 2)
```



### Exercise 4

```{r csv-files-4-setup}
cat(readLines("data/test_3.csv"), sep = "\n")
```

Consider the contents of the `test_3.csv` file. 

```{r comment = ''}
cat(readLines("data/test_3.csv"), sep = "\n")
```

### 

Write code that will create default names for the file by setting the `col_names` argument to `FALSE`.

```{r csv-files-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r csv-files-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
Use the `col_names argument and set it to FALSE
```

```{r csv-files-4-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
read_csv(file = "data/test_3.csv",
          col_names = ...)
```

###

The result when your code is run should look like this:

```{r}
read_csv("data/test_3.csv",
         col_names = FALSE)
        
```

### 

The argument `col_names()` can also be used to create custom column names. 

### Exercise 5

```{r csv-files-5-setup}
cat(readLines("data/test_3.csv"), sep = "\n")
```

Consider, again, the contents of the `test_3.csv` file. 

```{r comment = ''}
cat(readLines("data/test_3.csv"), sep = "\n")
```

### 

Using `col_names`, write code that will name the columns `a`, `b` and `c`, respectively. 

```{r csv-files-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r csv-files-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
Use the `col_names` argument and set it to c("a", "b", "c"). 
```

### 

The result when your code is run should look like this:

```{r}
read_csv("data/test_3.csv",
         col_names = (c("a", "b", "c")))
```




### Exercise 6


```{r csv-files-6-setup}
cat(readLines("data/test_3.csv"), sep = "\n")
```

Get rid of the column specification message by setting the `col_types` argument to `cols(a = col_double(), b = col_double(), c = col_double())`.


```{r csv-files-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

### 

The result when your code is run should look like this:

```{r}
read_csv("data/test_3.csv",
         col_names = (c("a", "b", "c")),
         col_types = cols(a = col_double(), 
                        b = col_double(), 
                        c = col_double()))
```

### 

There are many other arguments to `cols`. You can type `?cols` into your console to see all the different arguments!

### Exercise 7

```{r csv-files-7-setup}
cat(readLines("data/test_5.csv"), sep = "\n")
```

Consider the contents of the `test_5.csv` file. Note the "." for the first value for `b`. In this file, a period indicates a missing value. **This is not always true.** Missing values can be indicated in many different ways. And, sometimes, a period is just a period.

```{r comment = ''}
cat(readLines("data/test_5.csv"), sep = "\n")
```

### 

Write code to recognize the `.` value for `b` as an NA value by setting the `na` argument to "." in `read_csv`.

```{r csv-files-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r csv-files-7-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
Use the `na` argument and set it to "."
```

```{r csv-files-7-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
read_csv(file = "data/test_5.csv",
         na = ".")
```

### 

The result when your code is run should look like this:

```{r}
read_csv("data/test_5.csv",
         na = ".")
```

### Exercise 8

```{r csv-files-8-setup}
cat(readLines("data/test_6.csv"), sep = "\n")
```

Consider the contents of the `test_6.csv` file.

```{r comment = ''}
cat(readLines("data/test_6.csv"), sep = "\n")
```

### 

Write code for skipping the text lines within the file by setting the `comment` to "#".

```{r csv-files-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r csv-files-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
Use the `comment` argument and set it to "#".
```

```{r csv-files-8-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
read_csv(file = "data/test_6.csv",
         comment = "...")
```

### 

The result when your code is run should look like this:

```{r}
read_csv("data/test_6.csv",
         comment = "#")
```

### Exercise 9

```{r csv-files-9-setup}
cat(readLines("data/test_7.csv"), sep = "\n")
```

Consider the contents of the `test_7.csv` file.

```{r comment = ''}
cat(readLines("data/test_7.csv"), sep = "\n")
```

### 

Write code to make sure the column `grade` appear as an integer variable (`<int>`), and `student` as a character variable (`<chr>`).

```{r csv-files-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r csv-files-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
Use the col_types argument and set it 
to cols(grade = col_integer(), 
        student = col_character())
```

### 

The result when your code is run should look like this:

```{r}
read_csv("data/test_7.csv",
         col_types = cols(grade = col_integer(),
                          student = col_character()))
```

### 

It is smart to specify the data types because R could guess wrong!

### Exercise 10

Consider the following tibble `tbl_1`.

```{r}
tbl_1 <- tibble(John = 1 , Aliya = 2, Maxilla = 3)
tbl_1
```

### 

Use `write_csv()` to save this tibble to a file named "tbl_1.csv". *Note*: Nothing will be displayed for you to see. 

```{r csv-files-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r csv-files-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
The first argument should be the object you want 
to save. The second argument should be the name you 
want the file saved as.
```

```{r csv-files-10-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
See the Primer for guidance!
```

<!-- DK: add takeaway here -->

### Exercise 11

```{r csv-files-11-setup}
cat(readLines("data/tbl_1.csv"), sep = "\n")
```

Run `list.files()`. You should see your newly created file listed.

```{r csv-files-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

Your result should look like include two files: `exercise.Rmd`, which is a file used by the **learnr** package and `tbl_1.csv`, which is the file you created.


## Text Files

### 

CSV files are just one type of **text** file. A text file is any file which includes plain text. The contents of such files are easy to look at in any text editor, or in RStudio.

### Exercise 1

```{r text-files-1-setup}
cat(readLines("data/delim_1.txt"), sep = "\n")
```

Consider the contents of the text file `delim_1.txt`:

```{r}
cat(readLines("data/delim_1.txt"), sep = "\n")
```

### 

Write code for reading this file in to R. The values in the file are separated by pipes rather than commas. So, instead of `read_csv()`, you should use `read_delim()`. 

```{r text-files-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r text-files-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
Set the file argument to "data/delim_1.txt". 
Also use the `delim` argument and set it to "|".
```

### 

The result when your code is run should look like this:

```{r}
read_delim("data/delim_1.txt", delim = "|")
```

### 

Note how the spaces and commas are included in the values for `town`. You can't use `read_csv()` here because not all the columns are denoted by commas.


### Exercise 2

```{r text-files-2-setup}
cat(readLines("data/delim_2.txt"), sep = "\n")
```

Consider the contents of the text file `delim_2.txt`:

```{r}
cat(readLines("data/delim_2.txt"), sep = "\n")
```

### 

Write code for reading this file in to R. Also, use the `col_types` argument to both prevent the col_types message from printing out and to set `population` as an integer.

```{r text-files-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r text-files-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
Set the `col_types` argument to 
cols(date = col_date(format = ""),
     population = col_integer(),
     town = col_character())
```

### 

The result when your code is run should look like this:

```{r}
read_delim("data/delim_2.txt", 
           delim = "|",
           col_types = cols(date = col_date(format = ""),
                            population = col_integer(),
                            town = col_character()))
```



## Excel Files

### 

Excel is a spreadsheet program that use tables to analyze, store, or manipulate data. The tables are composed of cells which include text, numbers, or formulas.


### Exercise 1

```{r excel-files-1-setup}
cat(readLines("data/excel_1.xlsx"), sep = "\n")
```

Consider the contents of the excel file `excel_1.xlsx`:

```{r}
include_graphics("images/excel_1.png")
```

### 

Write code for reading this file in to R by using the `read_excel()` function from the **readxl** package.

```{r excel-files-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r excel-files-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
Use `read_excel()` and set the `path` argument to `data/excel_1.xlsx`.
```

### 

The result when your code is run should look like this:

```{r}
read_excel("data/excel_1.xlsx")

```

### 

We use `write.xlsx` from another package to write out Excel files, but it can be tricky.

### Exercise 2

```{r excel-files-2-setup}
cat(readLines("data/excel_1.xlsx"), sep = "\n")
```

Let's once again consider the contents of `excel_1.xlsx`. However, we want to look at the second sheet of the file. **Note**: Sheet 1 is the default when looking at an Excel file, so the last exercise only showed us the contents of Sheet 1.


```{r}
include_graphics("images/excel_2.png")
```

### 

Write code for reading the second sheet of the file into R by setting the `sheet` argument to "sheet 2".

```{r excel-files-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r excel-files-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
Use the `sheet` argument to look at other sheets.
Set `sheet` to "Sheet2".
```

### 

The result when your code is run should look like this:

```{r}
read_excel("data/excel_1.xlsx", sheet = "Sheet2")
```

### 

To write Excel files out, you need to use the `xlsx` package, which we will not cover.


## RDS Files

RDS files store R objects in a file which can be saved on your computer. Then, if you come back to a project, even after restarting R, you can quickly load back the object, without redoing all the code which created it.

### 

### Exercise 1

Consider the following plot.

```{r}
iris %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  labs(title = "Sepal Dimensions of Various Species of Iris",
       x = "Sepal Length",
       y = "Sepal Width")
```

### 

We have saved the plot for you to an object named `iris_p`. On the line 8, use `write_rds()` to save this plot to a file named "test_1.rds". *Note*: Nothing will be displayed for you to see.


```{r rds-files-1, exercise = TRUE}
iris_p <- iris %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  labs(title = "Sepal Dimensions of Various Species of Iris",
       x = "Sepal Length",
       y = "Sepal Width")

```

```{r rds-files-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
The first argument should be the object you want to save. 
The second argument should be the name you want the 
file saved as.
```

```{r rds-files-1-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
write_rds(iris_p, 
          "test_1.rds")
```

### 

The big advantage of creating an rds file is that we can reload the object it contains later, without re-running the code which created it.

### Exercise 2

```{r rds-files-2-setup}
cat(readLines("data/test_1.rds"), sep = "\n")
```

Run `list.files()`. You should see your newly created file listed.

```{r rds-files-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

### 

Your result should look like include two files: `exercise.Rmd`, which is a file used by the **learnr** package and `test_1.rds`, which is the file you created.



### Exercise 3

```{r rds-files-3-setup}
cat(readLines("data/test_1.rds"), sep = "\n")
```

Let's now use `read_rds()` to read in the newly created file! Set the `file` argument to "data/test_1.rds".

```{r rds-files-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r rds-files-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
read_rds(file = "data/test_1.rds")
```

### 

Plots are just one example of what we can store in and .rds file. We can also store datasets.

### Exercise 4

Consider the following dataset.

```{r}
glimpse(mtcars)
```

### 

Use `write_rds()` to save `mtcars` to a file named `test_2.rds`.

```{r rds-files-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r rds-files-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
The first argument should be the object you want to save. 
The second argument should be the name you want the 
file saved as.
```

```{r rds-files-4-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
write_csv(mtcars, "test_2.rds")
```

### 

You are not limited to just one object in an .rds file. You can save multiple!


### Exercise 5

```{r rds-files-5-setup}
cat(readLines("data/test_2.rds"), sep = "\n")
```

Run `list.files()`. You should see your newly created file listed.

```{r rds-files-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

### 

Your result should look like include two files: `exercise.Rmd`, which is a file used by the **learnr** package and `test_2.rds`, which is the file you created.



### Exercise 6

```{r rds-files-6-setup}
cat(readLines("data/test_2.rds"), sep = "\n")
```

Great. Let's now use `read_rds()` to read in the newly created file! Set the `file` argument to "data/test_2.rds".

```{r rds-files-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

## JSON files 

An increasingly common format for sharing data is JavaScript Object Notation or JSON. JSON is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax.

### 

### Exercise 1

```{r json-files-1-setup}
cat(readLines("data/test_1.json"), sep = "\n")
```

Consider the contents of the file `test_1.json`.


```{r}
cat(readLines("data/test_1.json"), sep = "\n")
```

### 

Write code for reading this JSON file into R as a tibble. Use the `fromJSON()` function from the **jsonlite** package.

```{r json-files-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r json-files-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
fromJSON("data/test_1.json")
```

### Exercise 2

Consider the following tibble, which is saved in the environment as an object called `example_1`.

```{r}
tibble(name= c("Miguel", "Sofia", "Aya", "Cheng"), 
                student_id = 1:4, exam_1 = c(85, 94, 87, 90), 
                exam_2 = c(86, 93, 88, 91))
```

### 

Write code to convert the following tibble into JSON format. Use the `toJSON()` function from the **jsonlite** package.

```{r json-files-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r json-files-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
toJSON(example_1)
```

### 

Reading data as a tibble is makes it much easier to view data, but we can make the JSON format cleaner by using the `pretty` argument in `toJSON`.


### Exercise 3

After converting from a tibble to the JSON format, it is hard to read the JSON format. To fix this, use the previous code and set the second argument `pretty` equal to `TRUE`.

### 

```{r json-files-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r json-files-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
toJSON(example_1, pretty = ...)
```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

### 

Now it is much easier to read the data with the JSON format.


### Exercise 4

What if the data has arrays? Let's test it out using `fromJSON()`.

### 

Try with the `json` object which has already been loaded with arrays. Use `fromJSON()` to display the arrays. 
```{r}
json<- '[
  [1, 2, 3, 4],
  [5, 6, 7, 8],
  [9, 10, 11, 12]
]'
```

```{r json-files-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r json-files-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
fromJSON(json)
```

### 

As you can see, `fromJSON()` can display arrays as well, which can be useful for datasets that include matrices. 

### Exercise 5

You can also write arrays with the same number of rows and columns to a JSON format using `toJSON()`. Display a 3x3 array in JSON format.

```{r json-files-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r json-files-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
json2 <- '[[..., ..., ...], [..., ..., ...], [..., ..., ...]]'

```

```{r json-files-5-hint-2, eval = FALSE}
json2 <- '[[..., ..., ...], [..., ..., ...], [..., ..., ...]]'
toJSON(json2)
```
###

Matrices with the square dimensions can be used to determine the determinant, which is very important operation used in calculus and linear algebra. 

## Parsing a vector

There are many `parse_*()` functions that break down the most important parts of an individual vector.

### 

### Exercise 1

People write numbers differently in different parts of the world. For example, some countries use `.` in between the integer and fractional parts of a real number, while others use `,`.

### 

To begin, use the function  `parse_double()` with the argument "1.23".

```{r parsing-a-vector-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r parsing-a-vector-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
parse_double("1.23")
```

### Exercise 2

What if the file you worked with used a comma to denote a decimal mark? The **readr** package has whats called a “locale”, an object that specifies parsing options that differ from place to place.You can override the default value of . by creating a new locale and setting the `decimal_mark` argument.

### 

Use `parse_double()` with the argument "1,23". The second argument should set `locale` to `locale(decimal_mark = ",")`.

```{r parsing-a-vector-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r parsing-a-vector-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
parse_double("1,23", locale = ...)
```

Note that **readr’s** default locale is US-centric because R is generally US-centric.


### Exercise 3

The function `parse_number()` ignores non-numeric characters before and after the number. 

### 

Use `parse_number()` with the argument "$100". Then on the line below, use `parse_number()` again with the argument "20%".


```{r parsing-a-vector-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r parsing-a-vector-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}

```

Notice how R will ignore both the % and $ signs. 


### Exercise 4

Great. Now use `parse_number()` with the argument "The cost of the package is $40.75" 

```{r parsing-a-vector-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r parsing-a-vector-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
parse_number("The cost of ...." )
```

###

`parse_number()` can even scan through full sentences and pick out just the numbers!


### Exercise 5

The function `parse_date()` allows you to parse a date. The function requires the following criteria: a four digit year,  a `-` or `/`, the month, a `-` or `/`, then the day. An example would be "2010-10-01".

### 

Use `parse_date()` to parse the following date: "2009-12-06"

```{r parsing-a-vector-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r parsing-a-vector-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
parse_date("...")
```

### Exercise 6

Great. Now use `parse_date()` on the date April 16, 2019.

```{r parsing-a-vector-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r parsing-a-vector-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
parse_date("2019-04-16")
```

### Exercise 7

If you are working with time and a date in a file, you can also use the function `parse_datetime()`. It requires a format where the components of a date are organized from biggest to smallest: year, month, day, hour, minute, second.

### 

Use `parse_datetime()` with the argument "2010-10-01T2010".

```{r parsing-a-vector-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

## Parsing a file 

### 

**readr** reads the first 1000 rows of each column and uses heuristics to figure out the data type of each column of a file. However, the first thousand rows might be a special case. For instance, you might have a column of doubles that only contains integers in the first 1000 rows.



### Exercise 1

Sometimes the defaults **reader** generates don’t always work for larger files. Run `read_csv("data/ex_1.csv")` and examine the parsing failures.


```{r parsing-a-file-1-setup}
cat(readLines("data/ex_1.csv"), sep = "\n")
```

```{r parsing-a-file-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r parsing-a-file-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
read_csv("data/ex_1.csv")
```

Note the two printed outputs: the column specification generated by looking at the first 1000 rows, and the first five parsing failures. 


### Exercise 2

To look at the problems in more depth, pipe the results of `read_csv("data/ex_1.csv")` to the function `problems()`.

```{r parsing-a-file-2-setup}
cat(readLines("data/ex_1.csv"), sep = "\n")
```


```{r parsing-a-file-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

### 

A good strategy is to work column by column until there are no problems remaining. Here we can see that there are a lot of parsing problems with the `y` column.

### Exercise 3

If we look at the last few rows, you’ll see that they’re dates stored in a character vector. Continue the pipe by adding `tail()` at the end. 

```{r parsing-a-file-3-setup}
cat(readLines("data/ex_1.csv"), sep = "\n")
```

```{r parsing-a-file-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r parsing-a-file-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
 tail()
```


### Exercise 4

To fix the call, use the `col_types` argument and copy/paste the column specification into your original call. 

```{r parsing-a-file-4-setup}
cat(readLines("data/ex_1.csv"), sep = "\n")
```

```{r parsing-a-file-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r parsing-a-file-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
read_csv("data/ex_1.csv", 
  col_types = cols(
    x = col_double(),
    y = col_logical()
  )
)
```

### Exercise 5

Let's now fix the type of the `y` column by specifying that `y` is a date column.

```{r parsing-a-file-5-setup}
cat(readLines("data/ex_1.csv"), sep = "\n")
```


```{r parsing-a-file-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r parsing-a-file-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
read_csv("data/ex_1.csv", 
  col_types = cols(
    x = col_double(),
    y = col_date()
  )
)
```

### 

With this last file, we used the `col_types` argument to `read_csv()` to resolve the failures. However, we will now explore a different approach using different parsing functions we learned in the "Parsing a vector" section.



### Exercise 6

Let's explore another file `ex_2.csv` that has parsing failures. Run the following code chunk to see parsing failures.

```{r parsing-a-file-6-setup}
cat(readLines("data/ex_2.csv"), sep = "\n")
```

```{r parsing-a-file-6, exercise = TRUE}
read_csv("data/ex_2.csv")
```

### Exercise 7

Let's once again look at the failures in depth. Pipe the results of `read_csv("data/ex_2.csv")` to the function `problems()`.

```{r parsing-a-file-7-setup}
cat(readLines("data/ex_2.csv"), sep = "\n")
```

```{r parsing-a-file-7, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>


### 

Notice that R parses column `a` and `b` both as a doubles. However, column `a` should be parsed as an integer and column `b` should be parsed as a date. Let's fix this.



### Exercise 8

Begin by using `read_csv()` to read in the file `ex_2.csv`. Then, set the `col_types` argument to `cols()`. Within `cols()`, set `.default` to `col_character()`.

```{r parsing-a-file-8-setup}
cat(readLines("data/ex_2.csv"), sep = "\n")
```

```{r parsing-a-file-8, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r parsing-a-file-8-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
read_csv(..., 
         col_types = cols(.default = ...)
)
```

### 

We specify the columns as characters first because the parse functions, that we are about to use, generally work with characters.


### Exercise 9

Pipe the results of `read_csv()` to the function `mutate()`. Within `mutate()` set `a` to `parse_integer(a)`. 

```{r parsing-a-file-9-setup}
cat(readLines("data/ex_2.csv"), sep = "\n")
```

```{r parsing-a-file-9, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r parsing-a-file-9-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
    mutate(a = ...)
```

### 



### Exercise 10

Continue your pipe with `mutate()`. Use `parse_date()` to transform `b` to dates. The first argument to `parse_date()` should be `b`. The second argument should be `format`. Set `format` to `"%Y%M%D"`.

```{r parsing-a-file-10-setup}
cat(readLines("data/ex_2.csv"), sep = "\n")
```

```{r parsing-a-file-10, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r parsing-a-file-10-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
  mutate(b = parse_date(b, format="..."))
```

### 

`"%Y%M%D"` tells R to read the number as a date (Y for year, M for month, D for date).


### Exercise 11

Let's explore one last file `ex_3.csv` that has parsing failures. Run `read_csv("data/ex_3.csv")` and examine the parsing failures.


```{r parsing-a-file-11-setup}
cat(readLines("data/ex_3.csv"), sep = "\n")
```

```{r parsing-a-file-11, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r parsing-a-file-11-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
read_csv("data/ex_3.csv")
```

What are the problems here? First, R parses column `x` as a character, when it is clearly a date. Also, column `z` should be parsed as an integer not a character!

### Exercise 12

Let's first fix column `x`. Pipe the results of `read_csv("data/ex_3.csv)` to the function `mutate()`. Within `mutate()` set `x` to `parse_date(x)`. 

```{r parsing-a-file-12-setup}
cat(readLines("data/ex_3.csv"), sep = "\n")
```

```{r parsing-a-file-12, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r parsing-a-file-12-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
    mutate(x = ...)
```

### 

Note that we did not need to use the `.default = col_character()` trick before we used `mutate()`. Why? Because R already read all of the columns as characters to begin with.


### Exercise 13

Continue your pipe with `mutate()`. Within `mutate()` set `z` to `parse_integer(z)`. 

```{r parsing-a-file-13-setup}
cat(readLines("data/ex_3.csv"), sep = "\n")
```

```{r parsing-a-file-13, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick = "transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r parsing-a-file-13-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... %>% 
    mutate(z = ...)
```

```{r download-answers, child = "../../child_documents/download_answers.Rmd"}
```
