<!-- we could do "projects," which would cover more ground in terms of putting together projects with lots of files. Cover the **here** package. And maybe other topics from https://rstats.wtf/.  Should certainly cover the .Rprofile file. Have examples of changing it, adding a print statement, restarting R, seeing the print statement (and copy/pasting what you see as proof). Always using the **usethis** commands. -->

<!-- Perhaps also discuss the .Renviron file. Maybe some (fake?) examples of issues associated with (not) using :: to identify the package from which you want the function to come. -->

<!-- Perhaps we save gists for this tutorial. Don't want RStudio and friends to be too long. -->

<!-- Maybe also discuss base R versus tidyverse so that students are not confused when they see base R. Have a tutorial for this. Maybe there is a week 4 tutorial which covers all the random R topics we failed to cover before. -->

<!-- What to do with PDF and tinytex? This all seemed to work very easily. Maybe just install and then issue packageVersion("tinytex")? -->

<!-- CHECKLIST BEFORE STARTING: -->
<!-- * Load necessary libraries for tutorial in the first code chunk -->
<!-- * Edit yaml at the START OF THIS FILE -->
<!-- * Review: https://ppbds.github.io/primer.tutorials/articles/instructions.html -->
